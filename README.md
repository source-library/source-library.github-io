# Welcome Viewers!

This extensive factsheet is a compilation of various studies, datapoints, pieces of academic literature, media, and otherwise helpful and informative resources aimed at combating reactionary rhetoric and detailing the many logical approaches to justifying leftist and progressive values.

#### On doc changes

The original source library was created as a Google document on June 15, 2019, but was flagged without warning nor reason on December 6, 2020. It was recreated as another Google doc and lasted until late November 2022. It has since moved to this new location. As it has been taken down multiple times before, it's possible it could be taken down again. Feel free to download these webpages onto your own device as an html or [archive it with a webpage archiver](https://web.archive.org/save "archive it with a webpage archiver").

#### Some other notes:

This factsheet is constantly updating and greatly benefits from viewer input! Feel free to contact us with any comments or suggestions you might have! Again, check the discord for the fastest responses.

This isn't the sort of doc you send over to someone if you‚Äôre in the middle of a debate. Telling someone to just debunk a 200+ page document off-hand is just a bad-faith approach which won‚Äôt win people over. It‚Äôs better to use this document as a source reference, and to use those specific sources in a debate rather than just throwing the whole google doc at people.

If you want to look further into reading studies so you can more critically analyze them and etc, give this a look. This sort of stuff is especially helpful for beginners, and plenty of guides like this exist online in case the one linked here isn‚Äôt helpful.

It's highly recommended that you at least skim some of these sources and become familiar with some of them. Citing these blindly is a risky and often bad-faith thing to do. Take your time learning about subjects before trying to talk about them.

For clarity, this is NOT Vaush‚Äôs [Ultimate Research Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ido70LgXsEhxcnyXE7RVS0wYJZc6aeVTpujCUPQgTrE/edit). We did start this as a copy of his doc, but no, they‚Äôre not the same thing.
