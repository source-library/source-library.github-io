## Some other notes:

- This factsheet is constantly updating and greatly benefits from viewer input! Feel free to contact us with any comments or suggestions you might have! Again, check the discord for the fastest responses.

- If you want to look further into reading studies so you can more critically analyze them and etc, give [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1naBql7CTY8Wgw-kDJ7dytnqrBjGNKyHbAbnNBEOzBuQ/edit) a look. This sort of stuff is especially helpful for beginners, and plenty of guides like this exist online in case the one linked here isn’t helpful.

- It's highly recommended that you at least skim some of these sources and become familiar with some of them. Citing these blindly is a risky and often bad-faith thing to do. Take your time learning about subjects before trying to talk about them.

- For clarity, this is NOT Vaush’s [Ultimate Research Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ido70LgXsEhxcnyXE7RVS0wYJZc6aeVTpujCUPQgTrE/edit). We did start this as a copy of his doc, but no, they’re not the same thing.
