<summary>Anti-American Terrorism</summary>

# **Anti-American Terrorism**
` `**Anti-American terrorism is primarily fueled by foreign policy and a legacy of interventionalism, rather than a distrust in democracy or “western values.”**

- [Pew Research: Kohut 05](https://www.pewresearch.org/2005/11/10/arab-and-muslim-perceptions-of-the-united-states/)
  - An analysis of Middle Eastern perceptions and their relations to terrorism
  - Found that the U.S. is less popular in the Middle East than in any other part of the world and that *“anti-Americanism around the world is **driven** first and foremost by **opposition to U.S. foreign policy**.”*
  - High pluralities in all Middle Eastern countries surveyed cited opposition to the U.S. based on:
    - The war in Iraq
    - The war on terror
    - the perception that America acts unilaterally on the world stage
    - U.S. policy in the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict
  - Also found that Middle Easterners do not hate so-called “Western values” nor cite that as a point of opposition against the U.S.
    - *“overwhelming majorities of Jordanians, Lebanese, and Moroccans say **democracy** is not just a Western way of governance, and that **it can work in their countries**”*

- [Pew Research 05](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2005/07/14/islamic-extremism-common-concern-for-muslim-and-western-publics/)
  - Support for democracy is high in Middle Eastern countries; the public generally does not have a hatred for perceived “Western values”
  - The following proportions of the public say that democracy can work well and is not just for the West:
    - Morocco (83%)
    - Lebanon (83%)
    - Jordan (80%)
    - Indonesia (77%)
    - Turkey (48%)
    - Pakistan (43%)

<summary>Arms Deals</summary>

# **Arms Deals**
**Arms deals and similar forms of military aid create, prolong, and intensify conflict.**

- [CATO: Thrall and Dorminey 18](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy%23full)
  - Arms sales **make conflict more likely**.
  - Recipients of new weapons feel more confident about launching attacks or because changes in the local balance of power can fuel tensions and promote preventive strikes by others.
  - Arms sales can also **prolong and intensify ongoing conflicts** and **erode regional stability**
  - Studies:
    - Sub-Saharan Africa study: “arms transfers are significant and positive predictors of increased probability of war.’”
    - Africa study: “Weapons imports are essential additives in this recipe for armed conflict and carnage.”
