# **Predictors of Crime**
**While there are a number of predictors of crime, there’s uncertainty as to what all of the predictors are and how impactful each one truly is. This is a complicated issue and needs a multi-faceted approach, not just something like “increase welfare” or “increase police”.**

<summary>Rehabilitation</summary>

# **Rehabilitation**
**Rehabilitation instead of imprisonment is shown to curb crime, lower cost, and increase employment. Check out [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1icJdF7LQtqKybnqz-Lqe7wVWx6OGDp2yLG4EE_q2UW4/edit) as well.**

  - Includes a **META-ANALYSIS** of **58 studies** of recidivism, or the rate at which criminals return to jail, after rehabilitation programs.
  - Analysts found that inmates who participated in **correctional education programs** had a **43% lower odds of recidivating** compared to inmates who did not, thus indicating that correctional education is an effective strategy for reducing recidivism
  - The odds of **obtaining employment** postrelease among inmates who participate in correctional education was **13% higher** than for those who did not

  - Cost- effective: *“Our cost analysis showed that correctional education is **highly cost-effective** for incarcerated adults: For **every dollar spent** on correctional education, **five dollars are saved** on three year reincarceration costs.”* (pg 23 of pdf)
  - Also found minimal publication bias in research

- [United States Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/archives/prison-reform)
  - Recommends various methods by which recidivism can be reduced
  - **Nearly all recommendations made are prisoner-oriented, rehabilitative practices**. This includes but is not limited to:
    - [Building a “school district” within the prison system](https://www.bja.gov/Publications/RAND_Correctional-Education-Meta-Analysis.pdf)
    - Prioritizing mental health of prisoners
    - Equipping prisoners with appropriate information and resources as they return to the community
  - **Not once are “harsher prison sentences” or other punitive methods recommended as a means by which to reduce recidivism**

- [APAC-run rehabilitation programs in Brazil](https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2013/mar/15/unique-brazilian-prison-alternative-celebrates-40-year-anniversary/)
  - In these systems, prisoners are given much more freedom and are treated much more humanely compared to mainstream Brazilian prisons. Recidivism by inmates here has been below 10%
  - Some limitations, e.g. non-comprehensive data and possible selection bias favoring those who have better backgrounds. Despite this, it's still a widely praised and very promising option

  - Generally, compared to traditional non-restorative approaches, **restorative justice was found to be a more effective method** of improving victim and/or offender satisfaction, increasing offender compliance with restitution, and decreasing recidivism of offenders.
  - Restorative programs found to be **significantly more effective criminal justice responses** than incarceration, probation, court-ordered restitution, etc.
  - It’s argued that **restorative and rehabilitative justice programs compose a comprehensive response to criminal behavior** by capitalizing on each of their strengths while minimizing their weaknesses.

# **Private Prisons**
**The private prison-industrial complex has no or little cost saving benefits compared to public prisons, and high social costs such as tragically higher recidivism and poor rehabilitative opportunities. The [Prison Policy Initiative](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports.html) is a great resource on the ineffectiveness of the prison system and criminal justice reform.**

- Prisoners at private prisons in Minnesota have dangerously higher recidivism rates than state owned prisons. Attributable to fewer vocational and rehabilitative opportunities [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0734016813478823?casa_token=X2hR6uTvFfIAAAAA%3AXxFhDKQlBVnWSTu-bet_3DVYobw6OFtMFE4dbEaPsU6YjLtJkZ8cif8DDJMjcHlEHTZZ7pubXA](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0734016813478823?casa_token=X2hR6uTvFfIAAAAA:XxFhDKQlBVnWSTu-bet_3DVYobw6OFtMFE4dbEaPsU6YjLtJkZ8cif8DDJMjcHlEHTZZ7pubXA)

- Meta-analysis research shows that private prisons are no more cost-effective than state prisons. The best indicators of cost effectiveness are economies of scale, age, and security level [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0011128799045003004?casa_token=A1a3oNqpnloAAAAA:ahXlPQxl1V0sJG4YFleNCHuOl8pcrh_h94talwCR4QmqHHhyWQVJxtJ30DyVhTLDJRyhEQ2zXQ](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0011128799045003004?casa_token=A1a3oNqpnloAAAAA:ahXlPQxl1V0sJG4YFleNCHuOl8pcrh_h94talwCR4QmqHHhyWQVJxtJ30DyVhTLDJRyhEQ2zXQ)

# **Death Penalty**
**Feel free to cite [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jc30ECidjRdsP5BrSyt5lu07DOP6FB4PGmC9Ok9tiMI/edit) for convenience. The [Death Penalty Information Center](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/) provides a great collection of resources on the death penalty and etc if you want to take a look.**

## The Death Penalty is Not a Deterrent

To start off with [a bit from Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/48000/act500062008en.pdf) - “[The argument that death penalty deters crime] *supposes that criminals study and anticipate the consequences of getting caught, and decide that a long term of imprisonment is acceptable, whereas execution is not. Many crimes are committed on the spur-of-the-themoment, leaving little opportunity for potential punishments to influence whether the crime is committed in the first place as criminals do not believe they will be caught and held to account.* ... *Once criminals have knowingly committed a capital offence, they no longer have any interest in lessening their potential punishment by not committing further murders or other offences. For example, if armed robbery carries the death penalty, the robber loses nothing by committing murders while attempting to flee.*”

- [Do executions lower homicide rates?](https://files.deathpenaltyinfo.org/legacy/files/DeterrenceStudy2009.pdf)
  - Looks at the **opinions of leading criminologists on the topic of the death penalty detering murder**
  - 88.2%** of the respondents said no to the question: *“Do you feel that the death penalty acts as a deterrent to the commitment to murder—that it lowers the murder rate, or not?”*
  - In 1996, 83.6% said no to that question, so expert consensus has been consistent
![](https://github.com/source-library/source-library.github.io/blob/main/assets/prisons-crime-03.jpg?raw=true)

- [NAS Death Penalty Deterrence Evaluation in 2012](https://files.deathpenaltyinfo.org/legacy/documents/NatResCouncil-Deterr.pdf)
  - A panel of the National Academy of Sciences unanimously concluded that there was **no credible evidence that the death penalty does or does not deter homicides**, mainly because **not enough research has been done** into the subject

- [Deterrence or Brutalization? An Impact Assessment of Oklahoma's Return to Capital Punishment](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-9125.1994.tb01148.x)
  - Looks at Oklahoma, where the death penalty was abolished then put back in
  - Finds death penalty is not a deterrent

- [Uses and abuses of emperical evidence in the death penalty debate](http://users.nber.org/~jwolfers/papers/DeathPenalty\(SLR\).pdf) ([cited](https://outline.com/5b8sts))
  - Suggets that the deterrence argument should be taken out of the death penalty debate

- [Reconsidering the Death Penalty in a Time of Economic Crisis](https://files.deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/pdf/CostsRptFinal.f1560295688.pdf)
  - A **poll of police chiefs rank the death penalty at the bottom of their priorities for safer societies**
  - They say the death penalty in the U.S. is an enormously expensive and wasteful program with no clear benefits

  - Study in Hong Kong (who abolished the death penalty in the 90s) and Singapore (who increased use of it)
  - Finds no detectable effect on crime with use of death penalty
![](https://github.com/source-library/source-library.github.io/blob/main/assets/prisons-crime-05.jpg?raw=true)

## The Dealth Penalty Comes With an Expensive Cost

[Studies from a number of states](https://www.amnestyusa.org/issues/death-penalty/death-penalty-facts/death-penalty-cost/) all come to the conclusion that the death penalty is more expensive compared to alternative routes, including costs being:
- 70% higher in Kansas
- 48% higher in Tennessee
- 3x higher in Maryland
- 12x higher in California

Similar results have been found in other states. **[This study](https://scholarlycommons.susqu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1026&context=supr), which rounds up info from various other studies into *figure one***, finds that across the board cases which seek the death penalty cost more than those that do not:

|**The State**|**$ Seeking Death Penalty**|**$ Not Seeking Death Penalty**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
|Maryland|2,400,000|1,100,000|
|California|2,087,926|1,460,604|
|Connecticut|380,000|177,635|
|Indiana|449,887|407,229|
|Kansas|1,200,000|740,000|
|Arizona|143,604|70,231|
|Montana|1,200,000|800,000|
|Oklahoma|3,500,000|1,000,000|
|Ohio|3,000,000|1,000,000|
|Federal level|620,942|77,618|
|**Cost Average**|**$1,498,235**|**$683,331**|
Keep in mind that there’s a good amount of variation between state costs, which could come down to different state data collection methods or different processes for other stuff. This does not dispute the higher cost of cases seeking the death penalty, though. This is also just explicit costs, and doesn’t take into account post-execution costs, healthcare matters, etc. which would raise costs further.

So why are death penalty costs so high? [DeathPenaltyInfo](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/policy-issues/costs) provides a basic list of reasons for why the death penalty costs so much, including:

- More stuff happens pre-trial
- Longer trials
- More time spent on jury selection process
