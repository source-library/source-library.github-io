# **Predictors of Crime**
**While there are a number of predictors of crime, there’s uncertainty as to what all of the predictors are and how impactful each one truly is. This is a complicated issue and needs a multi-faceted approach, not just something like “increase welfare” or “increase police”.**

## Inequality

([Document link for sources on inequality](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MtypVoAnSAZDbuDjX1y4j5eqU4lTdaOq42DdPiowDUE/edit))

- https://equalitytrust.org.uk/crime
  - Rates of violence are higher in more unequal societies.  This finding holds up in many different contexts, when looked at via different methodologies and after controlling for other determinants of crime such as low income, unemployment, and teen birth rates.
  - Small permanent decreases in inequality - such as reducing inequality from the level found in Spain to that in Canada - would reduce homicides by 20% and lead to a 23% long-term reduction in robberies[4].
The evidence on the link between changes in income inequality and crime is less clear than the evidence on income inequality and crime at one point in time. While there is a consensus that property crime and some types of violent crime – homicide, murder and robbery - are related very strongly to changing income inequality, it is more ambiguous as to whether other types of violent crime, such as rape and assault, are affected by inequality
  - **Inequality affects crime through these mechanisms:**
    - It may stimulate social competition and so encourage violence or may curtail opportunities for some, giving rise to a sense of hopelessness which incites fear, violence and murder.
    - Low levels of trust in (highly) unequal countries may provide the link which leads from higher inequality to high murder rates. Such societies may lack the social capacity to prevent violence and create safe communities. Experiences of inferiority may make someone less inclined to behave in a socially desirable way. This materialises as increased aggressive behaviour and high crime rates.

- https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/655357
  - “The same could be said of the empirical status of economic/resource deprivation theory. One of its key theoretical variables-poverty-was also one of the five strong and stable predictors of crime noted in table 3. To be sure, these analyses show that in addition to having a substantially robust mean effect size (ADJz = 0.253), the effect of poverty on crime is not significantly conditioned by methodological factors (e.g., measurement differences, model specification variations, and so on). The effect of inequality on crime is only slightly smaller in effect size (ADJz = 0.207), and it fell into the moderate categories for both strength and stability in table 3. Given the relative strength and stability of the relationships between poverty, inequality, and crime, therefore, economic/resource deprivation theory was designated as having received strong empirical support across studies.”

- https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24095661_Inequality_And_Crime
  - This paper considers the relationship between inequality and crime using data from urban counties. The behavior of property and violent crime are quite different. Inequality has no effect on property crime but a strong and robust impact on violent crime, with an elasticity above 0.5. By contrast, poverty and police activity have significant effects on property crime, but little on violent crime. Property crime is well explained by the economic theory of crime, while violent crime is better explained by strain and social disorganization theories.

- https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2523129_Inequality_And_Violent_Crime
  - Crime rates and inequality are positively correlated (within each country and, particularly, between countries), and it appears that this correlation reflects causation from inequality to crime rates, even controlling for other crime determinants.

- https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2022/08/01/is-the-risk-of-crime-against-businesses-greater-in-more-unequal-countries/
  - Measured:
    - “inequality, measured using the Gini coefficient, against crime exposure among businesses (i.e., the average probability of theft incidence over 2006-2018).”
  - And found that:
    - “The plot, which is based on 122 countries covered in our dataset, reveals a clear positive association between crime and inequality with a correlation coefficient of 0.40. In South Africa, the most unequal country in the world with a Gini of 0.63, the chance that a firm will experience crime in a given year was 43.3 percent. In Kazakhstan, where inequality is moderate with a Gini of 0.28, the crime risk of businesses was just 17 percent.”
  - The result was that, for every 10% increase in the GINI coefficient, there was a 4% increase in such crime: 
    - “The results indicate that a one decile increase of the Gini coefficient is associated with a 4 percent increase of crime risk. This is a large increase compared to the 20 percent average crime risk in the sample.”

- http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/67733/3/blogs.lse.ac.uk-How_neighborhood_inequality.pdf
  - Finds that richer neighborhoods have higher crime rates the wider the income gap is with neighboring poorer neighborhoods, as those in the poorer neighborhoods weigh the benefits of where to commit crime, and choose the richer one. 

- http://repec.dems.unimib.it/repec/pdf/mibwpaper63.pdf
  - Review of the factors involved in crime:
    - “The papers presented and discussed permit to deduce that criminal behaviour is influenced by some specific factors: probability of punishment and apprehension, deterrence, differential wages between legal and illegal activities, wage inequality, level of education, unemployment, cultural and family background and other economic and social factors that may affect individual’s propensity to commit crimes such as cultural characteristics, age and sex.”

- https://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1058&context=clsoc_crim_facpub
  - “Their findings show that gender income inequality is a significant contributor to rape, but gender inequities in educational attainment and occupational status do not contribute significantly to this offense. The analysis also points to a number of other structural factors, including general income inequality, that are powerful predictors of rape.”

- https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-80897-8
  - “Humans sometimes cooperate to mutual advantage, and sometimes exploit one another. In industrialised societies, the prevalence of exploitation, in the form of crime, is related to the distribution of economic resources: more unequal societies tend to have higher crime, as well as lower social trust. We created a model of cooperation and exploitation to explore why this should be. Distinctively, our model features a desperation threshold, a level of resources below which it is extremely damaging to fall. Agents do not belong to fixed types, but condition their behaviour on their current resource level and the behaviour in the population around them. We show that the optimal action for individuals who are close to the desperation threshold is to exploit others. This remains true even in the presence of severe and probable punishment for exploitation, since successful exploitation is the quickest route out of desperation, whereas being punished does not make already desperate states much worse. Simulated populations with a sufficiently unequal distribution of resources rapidly evolve an equilibrium of low trust and zero cooperation: desperate individuals try to exploit, and non-desperate individuals avoid interaction altogether. Making the distribution of resources more equal or increasing social mobility is generally effective in producing a high cooperation, high trust equilibrium; increasing punishment severity is not.”

# **Rehabilitation**
**Rehabilitation instead of imprisonment is shown to curb crime, lower cost, and increase employment. Check out [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1icJdF7LQtqKybnqz-Lqe7wVWx6OGDp2yLG4EE_q2UW4/edit) as well.**

# **Private Prisons**
**The private prison-industrial complex has no or little cost saving benefits compared to public prisons, and high social costs such as tragically higher recidivism and poor rehabilitative opportunities. The [Prison Policy Initiative](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports.html) is a great resource on the ineffectiveness of the prison system and criminal justice reform.**

The [Death Penalty Information Center](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/) provides a great collection of resources on the death penalty and etc if you want to take a look.**

## The Death Penalty is Not a Deterrent

To start off with [a bit from Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/48000/act500062008en.pdf) - “[The argument that death penalty deters crime] *supposes that criminals study and anticipate the consequences of getting caught, and decide that a long term of imprisonment is acceptable, whereas execution is not. Many crimes are committed on the spur-of-the-themoment, leaving little opportunity for potential punishments to influence whether the crime is committed in the first place as criminals do not believe they will be caught and held to account.* ... *Once criminals have knowingly committed a capital offence, they no longer have any interest in lessening their potential punishment by not committing further murders or other offences. For example, if armed robbery carries the death penalty, the robber loses nothing by committing murders while attempting to flee.*”

- [Do executions lower homicide rates?](https://files.deathpenaltyinfo.org/legacy/files/DeterrenceStudy2009.pdf)
  - Looks at the **opinions of leading criminologists on the topic of the death penalty detering murder**
  - 88.2%** of the respondents said no to the question: *“Do you feel that the death penalty acts as a deterrent to the commitment to murder—that it lowers the murder rate, or not?”*
  - In 1996, 83.6% said no to that question, so expert consensus has been consistent

- [NAS Death Penalty Deterrence Evaluation in 2012](https://files.deathpenaltyinfo.org/legacy/documents/NatResCouncil-Deterr.pdf)
  - A panel of the National Academy of Sciences unanimously concluded that there was **no credible evidence that the death penalty does or does not deter homicides**, mainly because **not enough research has been done** into the subject

  - Finds no detectable effect on crime with use of death penalty
![](https://github.com/source-library/source-library.github.io/blob/main/assets/prisons-crime-05.jpg?raw=true)

## The Dealth Penalty Comes With an Expensive Cost

[Studies from a number of states](https://www.amnestyusa.org/issues/death-penalty/death-penalty-facts/death-penalty-cost/) all come to the conclusion that the death penalty is more expensive compared to alternative routes, including costs being:
- 70% higher in Kansas
- 48% higher in Tennessee
- 3x higher in Maryland
- 12x higher in California

Similar results have been found in other states. **[This study](https://scholarlycommons.susqu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1026&context=supr), which rounds up info from various other studies into *figure one***, finds that across the board cases which seek the death penalty cost more than those that do not:

|**The State**|**$ Seeking Death Penalty**|**$ Not Seeking Death Penalty**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
|Maryland|2,400,000|1,100,000|
|California|2,087,926|1,460,604|
|Connecticut|380,000|177,635|
|Indiana|449,887|407,229|
|Kansas|1,200,000|740,000|
|Arizona|143,604|70,231|
|Montana|1,200,000|800,000|
|Oklahoma|3,500,000|1,000,000|
|Ohio|3,000,000|1,000,000|
|Federal level|620,942|77,618|
|**Cost Average**|**$1,498,235**|**$683,331**|
Keep in mind that there’s a good amount of variation between state costs, which could come down to different state data collection methods or different processes for other stuff. This does not dispute the higher cost of cases seeking the death penalty, though. This is also just explicit costs, and doesn’t take into account post-execution costs, healthcare matters, etc. which would raise costs further.

So why are death penalty costs so high? [DeathPenaltyInfo](https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/policy-issues/costs) provides a basic list of reasons for why the death penalty costs so much, including:

- More stuff happens pre-trial
