  - Finds that Republicans disapprove of anthem protests more than military members.
    - “A whopping 77% of Republicans believe not standing for the anthem is disrespectful to the freedoms the anthem represents.”
- “Interestingly, a lesser percentage of U.S. military veterans polled (61%) believed not standing for the anthem was also disrespectful. In short, Republicans, who often associate the anthem with the military, are more likely to be offended on behalf of the military than veterans themselves.”
    - A significant 35% of military veterans DO NOT believe anthem protests are disrespectful. While 35% does not constitute a majority, it does make up a significant minority of dissent to put to rest common assumptions military members are a monolithic group with a monolithic opinion.

**CLAIM: If you don’t like the country, then leave!**

This is just an Ergo decedo fallacy. To respond to the criticism of a critic by implying that the critic is motivated by undisclosed favorability or affiliation to an out-group, rather than responding to the criticism itself isn’t a valid argument.
