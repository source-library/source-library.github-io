# **The Drug War - General**
**The war on drugs has wasted billions while coinciding with higher drug usage, production, and creation of new criminals while failing to stop substance abuse in any capacity.**

- [The Hill: Clark 18](https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/417228-another-decade-lost-to-the-global-war-on-drugs)
  - **$100 billion a year** is spent waging the war on drugs globally
  - **$40 billion** of that is spent in the United States alone
  - Despite this, drug use **rose by 31%** between 2011 and 2016.
  - Illegal drug markets have expanded relentlessly to meet this growing demand, with opium and [cocaine] production rising respectively by **130% and 34%** between 2009 and 2018.

- [Justice Policy Institute: McVay et al. 04](http://www.justicepolicy.org/uploads/justicepolicy/documents/04-01_rep_mdtreatmentorincarceration_ac-dp.pdf) 
  - Among drug offenders released from prison, **41.2%** will be **re-arrested** on another drug offense.

- [Center on Addiction 10](https://www.centeronaddiction.org/newsroom/press-releases/2010-behind-bars-II)
  - Approximately 65% of prison inmates in the US meet the diagnostic criteria for addiction [but] **only 11%** receive any form of treatment.
  - *“In 2005, federal, state and local governments spent **$74 billion** on incarceration, court proceedings, probation and parole for substance-involved adult and juvenile offenders and **less than 1%** of that amount—$632 million--on prevention and treatment for them”*

- [Skywood Recovery: O’Leary 18](https://skywoodrecovery.com/why-imprisonment-is-more-harm-than-help-to-addicted-offenders/)
  - Widely cited collection of statistics, although not from an academic source and thus should be used cautiously.
  - Approximately **95%** of incarcerated addicts will **return to substance abuse** after their release from prison.
  - **60% to 80%** of them will **commit new crimes.**
  - Others will become addicted while in prison due to access to **smuggled drugs.**
  - There have been a number of reports of individuals **dying from severe withdrawal** while in prison.

- [Pew 18](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2018/03/more-imprisonment-does-not-reduce-state-drug-problems) 
  - Great article on the failure of the war on drugs, but also features their own study on whether or not locking up drug offenders causes less drug use
  - *'Pew compared state drug imprisonment rates with three important measures of drug problems— self-reported drug use (excluding marijuana), drug arrest, and overdose death—and found **no statistically significant relationship between drug imprisonment and these indicators**'*
  - **The results hold even when controlling for standard demographic variables**, including the percentage of the population with bachelor’s degrees, the unemployment rate, the percentage of the population that is nonwhite, and median household income.*

<summary>Decriminalization</summary>

# **Decriminalization**
**The decriminalization of marijuana and other drugs has been demonstrated to massively reduce gang violence and decimate illegal markets.**

- [The Economic Journal: Gavrilova et al. 17](http://conference.iza.org/conference_files/riskonomics2015/zoutman_f21865.pdf)
  - Analyses the effects of medical marijuana laws, which institute lax criminal penalties, on homicides and drug prices at the southern border.
  - The study concludes that, when such policies are implemented:
    - **violent crimes** such as homicides and robberies **decrease** in states that border Mexico
    - **homicides decrease**, (due to drug-law and juvenile-gang related homicides being reduced)
    - the amount of cocaine seized at the border decreases, while the **price of cocaine is increased** (this makes it harder to obtain due to the strainput on the illegal market)

- [Drug Policy Alliance 15](http://www.drugpolicy.org/sites/default/files/DPA_Fact_Sheet_Portugal_Decriminalization_Feb2015.pdf) ([easier to read](https://transformdrugs.org/drug-decriminalisation-in-portugal-setting-the-record-straight/))
  - An empirical analysis of drug decriminalization in Portugal
  - As a result of decriminalizing all drugs, Portugal experienced:
    - No major increase in **overall drug use**
    - Reduced problematic and **adolescent drug use**
    - Reduced **drug-induced death**
    - More people receiving **drug treatment**
  - Over **70 percent** of those who seek treatment receive opioid-substitution therapy
  - This is while treatment is **still voluntary**
    - **Reduction in HIV** cases among people who use drugs declining from 1,575 to 78
    - **18% reduction** in the **social costs** of drug misuse (legal and health related)
  - The European Union also confirmed in 2013 that countries like Portugal that have decriminalized drug possession,  have not experienced increases in monthly rates of use – and in fact tend to have lower rates than countries with punitive policies
  - Separate informational piece - [Drug Policy Alliance](http://www.drugpolicy.org/sites/default/files/dpa-drug-decriminalization-portugal-health-human-centered-approach_0.pdf): notes also that overdose deaths **decreased by over 80%**

- [Choo et al. 14](https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X\(14\)00107-4/abstract) 
  - Looks at adolescent marijuana use before and after legalization of medical marijuana
  - *'There were **no statistically significant differences in marijuana use before and after policy change for any state pairing**. In the regression analysis, we did not find an overall increased probability of marijuana use related to the policy change'*

<summary>Treatment</summary>

# **Treatment**
**Drug treatment from a public health approach functions far more successfully at reducing drug addiction and abuse**

- [Chandler et al. 09](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2681083/)
  - A **META-ANALYSIS** of **78** comparison-group community-based drug treatment studies
  - Treatment is up to 1.8 times **[180%] better** in reducing drug use than the usual alternatives.
  - *“Research has consistently shown that community-based drug abuse treatment can **reduce drug use** and **drug-related criminal behavior.”***

- [de Andrade et al. 18](https://academic.oup.com/epirev/article/40/1/121/4992689)
  - *“Therapeutic communities are **effective in reducing recidivism** and, to a lesser extent, substance use after release.”*
  - *“Opioid maintenance treatment is effective in **reducing the risk of drug use** after release from prison for opioid users.”*
  - Both types of intervention are further enhanced by care after prison.

- [Justice Policy Institute: McVay et al. 04](http://www.justicepolicy.org/uploads/justicepolicy/documents/04-01_rep_mdtreatmentorincarceration_ac-dp.pdf) 
  - Offenders who went through treatment showed a nearly **two-thirds decline** in overall arrests and an over **50% drop** in drug possession arrests

# Safe Consumption Rooms

- [Potier et al. 14](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0376871614018754) 
  - Meta analysis of 75 studies on supervised injection services
  - *‘All studies converged to find that SISs **were efficacious in attracting the most marginalized PWID** [people who inject drugs], **promoting safer injection conditions, enhancing access to primary health care, and reducing the overdose frequency**. SISs were not found to increase drug injecting, drug trafficking or crime in the surrounding environments. **SISs were found to be associated with reduced levels of public drug injections and dropped syringes.’***

- [Marshall et al.11](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(10\)62353-7/fulltext)
  - Looks at the overdose mortality rate before and after the opening of a safe consumption room in Vancouver, the first in North America
  - *‘The fatal overdose rate in this area [500m radius of the centre] **decreased by 35·0%** after the opening of the SIF, from 253·8 to 165·1 deaths per 100 000 person-years’*
  - *‘By contrast, during the same period, the fatal overdose rate in the rest of the city decreased by only 9·3%, from 7·6 to 6·9 deaths per 100 000 person-years’*

- [Ng et al. 17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5685449/)
  - Another study on Vancouver
  - *‘Best evidence from cohort and modeling studies suggests that SISs are associated with **lower overdose mortality** (88 fewer overdose deaths per 100 000 person-years [PYs]), **67% fewer ambulance calls for treating overdoses, and a decrease in HIV infections**.’*

- [Bayoumi & Zaric 08](https://www.cmaj.ca/content/179/11/1143) 
  - Another study on Vancouver, this time concentrating on cost
  - *‘Focusing on the base assumption of decreased needle sharing as the only effect of the supervised injection facility, we found that the facility was associated with an incremental **net savings of almost $14 million and 920 life-years gained over 10 years**. When we also considered the health effect of increased use of safe injection practices, the incremental net savings increased to **more than $20 million and the number of life-years gained to 1070**. Further increases were estimated when we considered all 3 health benefits: the incremental **net savings was more than $18 million and the number of life-years gained 1175**.’*
