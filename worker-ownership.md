# **Worker Co-ops**
**Co-ops are more productive, robust, resistant to price shocks, and increase worker pay and engagement (as opposed to a firm organized by a traditional employer-employee framework). Check out [this resource](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NGbV3GAIxjQBOGetJFuWghhDLg5HurS-hN7kxibFDU4/edit) too for more information.**

- [Doucouliagos 95](https://library.uniteddiversity.coop/Cooperatives/Worker_Participation_and_Productivity-Meta_Analysis.pdf)
  - **Meta-analysis** of 43 studies comparing various forms of worker participation in business
  - Found that “profit sharing, **worker ownership**, and **worker participation in decision making** are all **positively associated with productivity**”
    - These observed correlations are stronger in worker-managed firms than in traditional capitalist firms
  - Bit outdated as it’s from 1995 and only shows correlation, but still useful

- [O’Boyle et al. 16](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304459942_Employee_ownership_and_firm_performance_a_meta-analysis_Employee_ownership_a_meta-analysis)
  - **Meta-analysis** of 102 samples representing **56,984 firms**
  - Finds that **employee ownership of businesses** has a **statistically significant but small impact** on business performance
  - “*We do find that the effect of employee ownership on performance has increased in studies over time and that studies with samples from outside the USA report stronger effects than those within.*”

- [Pérotin 12](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285356456_The_performance_of_worker_cooperatives)
  - The study found **increased productivity** in the case of:
    - Increased **profit sharing** *(note: this may also involve reverse causality, although data on ESOPs seems to thoroughly verify this anyway)*
    - A higher proportion of **employees becoming cooperative member**, thus increasing participation in decision-making (in France and Italy)
    - A greater proportion of **workers on the board** (in the UK)

- [Williams 07](https://library.uniteddiversity.coop/Cooperatives/The_Cooperative_Movement.pdf)
  - After 1 year, 50-60% of corporations fail while **only 10%** of cooperatives do
  - After 5 years, **90% of Co-Ops** remain open while only 3-5% of standard corporations do

- [Co-op Law](https://www.co-oplaw.org/special-topics/worker-cooperatives-performance-and-success-factors/)
  - Co-ops have been shown multilaterally to be **more resilient** and **less likely to fail** than traditionally-operated businesses
  - Coops also face **unique barriers to entry** which might be mitigated through the **transformation of existing enterprises** into worker’s coops.

- [Burdín & Dean  09](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596709000560)
  - Economic analysis of capitalist firms vs worker cooperatives in Uruguay from 1996-2005
  - Coops have a greater correspondence between profit increase and **wage increase**
  - Employment in coops is **more resistant to price shocks**
  - **Employment** has a negative correlation with wages for capitalist firms and a **positive correlation with wages** in worker coops

- [Abell 14](https://democracycollaborative.org/content/worker-cooperatives-pathways-scale)
  - Coops make $652 billion in revenue, hold around $3 trillion in assets, and employ nearly one million people in the U.S., showing that **coops are already successfully contributing to the U.S. economy**
  - Data shows that worker coops:
    - can **increase worker incomes by 70-80%**
    - have **9-19% greater levels of productivity**
    - have 45% lower turnover rates
    - are **30% less likely to fail** in the first few years of operation

- [Sabatini et al. 12](https://www.eeri.eu/documents/wp/EERI_RP_2012_10.pdf)
  - Study based on a 2011 questionnaire in Trento, Italy (where coops make up a substantial portion of businesses)
  - Found that employment in cooperative enterprises **increases trust between workers relative to public and private enterprises**
    - 47.5% increase relative to public enterprises
    - 36.9% increase relative to private enterprises

- [Park 18](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/ER-06-2017-0137/full/html)
  - In conventional firms, there is a **negative relationship between job demands and worker commitment**
  - This negative relationship was **not found in worker co-ops**

- [Erdal 12](https://www.oeockent.org/download/cooperatives/journal-of-cooperative-thought-and-practice-vol1-no1.pdf.pdf)
  - Study of three Italian towns of similar demographics, income, and geography
  - The town with the most worker cooperatives experienced the following:
    - **Better mental and physical health**, as well as longer lives
    - Children were less likely to skip school and skipped school less
    - **Less crime, including less domestic violence** and greater feelings of safety.
    - Higher rates of ‘social participation’ (joining clubs and charities, giving blood, voting)
    - **Perception of a more positive society, more supportive personal networks, and more trust in the government**
  - Note: this study **fails to prove causation**, and only establishes a correlation between coop prevalence and community wellbeing

<summary>ESOP and Employee Ownership</summary>

# **ESOP and Employee Ownership**
**Increased employee engagement in decision-making at all levels is consistently associated with better performance.**

- [NCEO (National Center for Employee Ownership) 17](https://www.ownershipeconomy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/employee_ownership_and_economic_wellbeing_2017.pdf)
  - Analyzing the effects of employee ownership (typically ESOPs, where workers gain a stake in their company and its stock)
  - Data shows:
    - **33% higher** income from wages (This holds true at all wage levels)
    - **53% longer** median job tenure (5.2 years compared to 3.4 years)
  - Employee owners also have access to an array of benefits at work including:
    - flexible work schedules
    - retirement plans
    - parental leave
    - tuition reimbursement
    - Childcare benefits (23% of employee-owners compared to 5% of non-employee-owners)

- [NCEO Economic Growth Report](https://www.nceo.org/assets/pdf/Economic_Growth_Through_EO.pdf)
  - More data on employee-owner firms
  - Compared to traditional firms, ESOP and companies with employee ownership:
    - Generate **2.5% more new jobs** per year
    - Have a workforce that is **⅓ to ¼ as likely to be laid off**

- [Kruse 02](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228871769_Research_Evidence_on_the_Prevalence_and_Effects_of_Employee_Ownership)
  - **Analysis of a variety of studies on employee ownership**
  - Productivity **improves by an extra 4-5%** on average in the year an ESOP (employee stock ownership) is adopted, and the higher productivity level is maintained in subsequent years.
    - This one-time jump is more than **twice the average** annual productivity growth of the U.S. economy over the past 20 years.
  - Most studies find **higher organizational commitment** and identification under employee ownership, while studies are mixed between favorable and neutral findings on job satisfaction, motivation, and other behavioral measures.

- [Kruse & Blasi 95](https://www.nber.org/papers/w5277.pdf)
  - **META-ANALYSIS of 52 studies** regarding employee ownership, focusing primarily on employee attitudes/behaviours and productivity/profitability
  - **Finds higher levels of employee commitment** in ESOPS but **mixed results in regards to stuff like satisfaction and motivation**
  - While it’s hard to make out a clear causal relation between **employee ownership and more productivity, the two factors are certainly associated** with each other
