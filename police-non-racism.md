# **Casualties**
- [BMJ Journals Injury Prevention: Miller et al. 17](https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/23/1/27)
  - Analyzed 12.3 million police interventions
  - **1,000 deaths** (2016)
  - **1 in 291 stops/arrests** resulted in hospital-treated injury or death of a suspect or bystander
  - **55,400 people were injured or killed** by cops during legal stop and search incidents in one year

- [Criminal Legal News: Zoukis 18](https://www.criminallegalnews.org/news/2018/mar/16/cops-killed-100-times-more-americans-terrorists-did-2017/)
  - Cops Killed **100 Times** More Americans Than Terrorists Did in 2017 (1,000 people)

- [Mapping Police Violence](https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/):
  - Black people are disproportionately killed by cops even though in these cases, blacks are more frequently unarmed than other races
  - Violent crime rate of a city does not correlate with rate of police violence in that city

- [Criminal Legal News: Chappell 18](https://www.criminallegalnews.org/news/2018/jun/16/doj-police-shooting-family-dogs-has-become-epidemic/)
  - The DOJ estimates that around **25 to 30** dogs are killed by cops **every day**, with some numbers as high as 10,000 per year.
  - The totals **could be higher** -- most police agencies do not formally track officer-involved shootings involving animals.

# **Policing Efficacy & Corruption**
- [Goldstein et al. 18](https://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/upload_documents/YOU_policing.pdf)
  - Police departments that collect **more in fees** and fines are **less effective** at solving crimes
  - “Specifically, we find that a **1 percent increase** in the share of own-source revenues from f**ees, fines, and forfeitures** collected by a municipality is associated with a **decrease** in the **violent crime clearance** rate of **3.7 percentage points**”
    - This relationship is proven through a variety of empirical strategies, the details of which are outlined extensively on the methodology

- [Mummolo 18](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/37/9181) ([cited](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/police-militarization-fails-to-protect-officers-and-targets-black-communities-study-finds))
  - Even after adjusting for local crime rates, **militarized police forces are disproportionately dispatched in African-American communities**
  - The common person is less likely to support militarized police forces, so **militarization would worsen the police force’s reputation**
    - Worsened reputation of police force is speculated to lead to more crime and to hindered investigations, as people trust the police less and perceive it as having less authority
  - Statistically significant **changes in police safety or crime reduction weren’t found when the police were militarized**

- [https://www.aele.org/loscode2000.html](https://www.aele.org/loscode2000.html)

- [According to a study from the US Department of Justice](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/181312.pdf) (based on survey data from police officers themselves):
  - **61% of cops "do not always report** even serious criminal violations that **involve the abuse of authority by fellow officers**."
  - **52% of cops** believed that "It is not unusual **for officers to ignore improper conduct** by their fellow officers."
  - A strong majority of cops **allow their fellow officers to get away with misconduct**, and believe that others do it as well. This is indicative of a culture of abuse within police departments
  - The use of force by police is very often improper; according to the DOJ, "**improper force was used in 38 percent of encounters that involved force**." More than one-third of all police uses of force are "improper," and those are just the ones that we know about!

- [Baughman 2020](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3566383)
  - The arrest and clearance rates for police are way off. While the number of reported crimes being solved is already absurdly low (**25% on a good year)**, it drops dramatically when we look at all crimes committed.
  - “**The true arrest rates below consider the known crimes compared to the arrest rates for those crimes.193 These numbers will demonstrate that police are solving even less crimes than we may have thought in the last Part. In fact, overall, a 10% arrest rate is typical for the major crimes combined—murder, rape/sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, larceny-theft, burglary, and motor vehicle theft.”** (Overall, the true percent arrested stayed in the 10% range largely between 1990 to 2018. )
  - The overall standard clearance rate, comparing total crimes reported to police with clearance rates in 2018, is **21.64%, meaning 78.36% of crimes are not cleared.**
  -  **True clearance rates presumably consider a large swath of crimes that could be reported to police but are not. Starting in 1990, the overall true percent of crimes cleared was 10.03%. In 1998, the true percent cleared was 7.92%.216 For 2004 and 2006, the overall true percent cleared was 9.26% and 9.19%, respectively. For 2009, police improved clearance to 12.10% of overall crimes, and in 2014, it was 11.71%. Finally, in 2018 the overall true percent cleared went back down to 10.61%. Overall, true clearance rates in the last thirty years remained around 10%.**

  - Tests the association between survey respondents’ perceptions of arrest risk and the level of police strength prevailing in the counties where they live.
  - **“No relationship between the number of police officers per capita and perceptions of the risk of arrest was found, suggesting that increases in police manpower will not increase general deterrent effects and decreases will not reduce these effects. The authors also considered the possibility that police manpower levels influence the number of criminals incarcerated, and thus affect crime rates via the incapacitative effects of incarceration, but concluded that such an effect is unlikely.”**
