This extensive factsheet is a compilation of various studies, datapoints, pieces of academic literature, media, and otherwise helpful and informative resources aimed at combating reactionary rhetoric and detailing the many logical approaches to justifying leftist and progressive values.

Since this document is rather large, I recommend using the outline while navigating (view -> show document outline)

On mobile, you’ll find vastly improved formatting by using the “Print Outline” setting. On PC, you might want to consider disabling “Print layout” so that page cut-offs don’t screw with how you access the doc.

# **On doc changes**
The original source library was created on June 15, 2019, but was flagged without warning nor reason on December 6, 2020. It has since moved to this new location. Feel free to download this doc (preferably as pdf) for your own use and convenience.

**Some other notes:**

This factsheet is constantly updating and **greatly benefits from viewer input**! Feel free to contact us with any comments or suggestions you might have!

This isn’t the sort of doc you send over to someone if you’re in the middle of a debate. Telling someone to just debunk a 200+ page document off-hand is just a bad-faith approach which won’t win people over. It’s better to use this document as a source reference, and to use those specific sources in a debate rather than just throwing the whole google doc at people.

**Note about sci-hub**: [Sci-Hub](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub) is a website that essentially lets you bypass academic paywalls. The site has several different domains and sometimes a domain will temporarily be dropped or rendered unusable (you can check working links [here](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://sci-hub-links.com/)). We have removed all sci-hub links from the Source Library to uphold DMCA law, but much of the paywalled studies in this doc can be accessed in full for free via sci-hub.

If you want to **look further into reading studies so you can more critically analyze them** and etc, give [this](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://docs.google.com/document/d/1naBql7CTY8Wgw-kDJ7dytnqrBjGNKyHbAbnNBEOzBuQ/edit) a look. This sort of stuff is especially helpful for beginners, and plenty of guides like this exist online in case the one linked here isn’t helpful.

It's highly recommended that you **at least skim some of these sources and become familiar with some of them**. Citing these blindly is a risky and often bad-faith thing to do, so it's something you'll certainly want to avoid.

This is NOT [Vaush’s ultimate research doc](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ido70LgXsEhxcnyXE7RVS0wYJZc6aeVTpujCUPQgTrE/edit). We did start this as a copy of his doc, but no, they’re not the same thing. Please stop calling this the vaush ultimate research doc.

# **Medical Transition**
**Medical transition decreases dysphoria, suicide attempts, and improves depression and anxiety. However, most research on this subject is very low quality so we should be open to conducting better future research. Check out [this section](https://archive.ph/uY9Yr#h.r75kvcg1x9ah) too**

● [Murad et al. 10](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19473181)

○ Meta-analysis of **28** studies on transition and hormones

○ Sex reassignment/hormonal improvements:

■ **80%** of individuals reported significant improvement in **dysphoria**

■ **78%** of individuals reported significant improvement in **psychological symptoms**

■ **72%** of individuals reported significant improvement in **sexual function**

■ **Positive results across the board, EVEN IN 15-YEAR FOLLOWUPS**

○ Low quality evidence, see methodology. Broader limitations to study quality for this topic are discussed [here](https://archive.ph/uY9Yr#h.ymac1prwomfv). Still significant and helpful findings regardless.

● [De Vries et al. 14](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25201798/)

○ Longitudinal study on the **effectiveness of puberty suppression, hormones, and later sex reassignment surgery** on trans individuals in improving mental outcomes

○ 55 trans youth (22 transfem and 33 transmasc) were followed over an 8 year period from before starting blockers (mean aged 13.6 years)

○ While many studies like this compare those after treatment to those before treatment, this study also made **comparisons to the general population** and still found that psychological function was on par or better.

○ *“After gender reassignment, in young adulthood, the GD was alleviated and psychological functioning had steadily improved. Wellbeing **was similar to or better than same-age young adults from the general population**.”*

● [Green et al. 22](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X\(21\)00568-1/fulltext)

○ Use of GAHT was associated with lower odds of recent depression and seriously considering suicide compared to those who wanted GAHT but did not receive it.

○ For youth under age 18, GAHT was associated with lower odds of recent depression and of a past-year suicide attempt.

○ “Findings support a relationship between access to GAHT and lower rates of depression and suicidality among transgender and nonbinary youth.”

● [The Endocrine Society 15](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-03/tes-sdc030615.php)

○ “*A new study has confirmed that **transgender youth often have mental health problems** and that their depression and anxiety **improve greatly with recognition** **and treatment of gender dysphoria***”

● [Nobili 18](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6223813/)

○ Longitudinal meta-analysis which indicates **transgender people** have a **lower quality of life** than the general population.

○ However, that quality of life **rises dramatically** with ‘**Gender Affirming Treatment**’, the nature of which is detailed extensively in-text.

● [Almazan & Keuroghlian 2021](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/article-abstract/2779429)

○ Study that **uses data from the US Transgender Survey (massive survey of 27,000+ people)** and does a covariate analysis to learn about the **association between medical transition and several mental health indicators**

○ Accounted for various demographic indicators including wealth (a neat finding about wealth was that those with wealth also tend to have better access to gender-affirming care, and thus were more able to benefit from that care)

○ Finds that “***TGD people with a history of gender-affirming surgery had significantly lower odds of past-month psychological distress, past-year tobacco smoking, and past-year suicidal ideation compared with TGD people with no history of gender-affirming surgery***”

■ Deeper in the study they reaffirm that **its conclusions support gender-affirmative care**, in line with past smaller-scale studies. “*The association observed between gender-affirming surgeries and reduction in substance use behaviors is consistent with previous studies involving small community samples that demonstrated associations between gender-affirming medical care and lower odds of high-risk substance use.*” **and** “*This investigation offers evidence to support the clinical practice of gender-affirming surgery.*”

○ Some clear limitations e.g. association doesn’t necessarily mean causation. This study is included in the list mainly due to the large sample it’s able to pull from. Use it with this in mind.

● **DO NOTE CITE THIS SOURCE**: [Cornell University, "What does the scholarly research say about the effect of gender transition on transgender well-being?"](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-well-being-of-transgender-people/)

○ Commonly cited source in favor of gender transition, however it’s flawed and those flaws have been known about for a while now.

○ [The study suffers from poor categorization among other things](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://medium.com/@JLCederblom/what-we-know-about-what-we-know-de5bdf2955dd). For example, a study with some positive and some negative results could be judged by Cornell as fitting in the “positive results” category, misrepresenting the overall pool of evidence on a subject with more nuance.

○ Many of the studies suffer from [small sample sizes, weak methodology, and sampling that can’t be generalized to transitioners more broadly](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2019/04/51524/) (though some of this is to be expected from the field in general, see next point).

○ The majority of studies on the subject [involve very small sample sizes](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://docs.google.com/document/d/17_Pe_pzFVw3U8Uom3SKJG-__mHuYJsXeR7-lohuF9-M/edit) which somewhat undermines their reliability. This is to be expected for the field though, due to the small size of the trans population (small populations are harder to get large samples of), so that’s ultimately to be expected.
## Long-term Follow-ups:

○ **50 MtF trans people** who had done SRS **6 months earlier**

○ In **long-term follow-ups**, trans women "***function well on a physical, emotional, psychological and social level***"

○ However, they have problems when it comes to arousal, lubrication, and pain - a minor trade-off for the previously mentioned well-being measures

● [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9031580/](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9031580/) follow-up for each participant happened ‘no less than 1 year’ after surgery

*For info on the commonly misused [Sweden study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21364939), see [this section](https://archive.ph/uY9Yr#h.25px37zhtqwb).*
## Important note on study quality (applicable to some other sections too):
For some research topics like medical transition, it’s very hard to get gold-standard study designs for a number of practical and ethical reasons. I’ll be pulling relevant info from [this blog post](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/www.cakeworld.info/news/2014-08-02acommentaryonthe2004arifstudyandtheguardianarticlesexchangesarenoteffectivesayresearchers) which largely focuses on a different topic yet has some good info for this. In this segment it talks about how having [blinded studies](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinded_experiment) and [control groups](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_and_control_groups) (two ways to improve a study’s quality) is next to impossible for researchers to do here:

● “*One problem with medical treatment (and obviously surgery) for transsexuals is that **blinding of studies is not possible**. It is immediately obvious whether a participant received treatment or not, substitution by placebo will not work for obvious reasons. Clearly, all sex reassignment studies thus fail the gold standard.*”

● “***The next issue is including a* [transgender] *control group into the study***. This would require to properly diagnose transsexuals, making sure they meet the requirements and indications for sex reassignment surgery, and then to randomly split the participants into two groups – one receiving surgery and one not... In reality, you would find the pressure transsexuals find themselves under grow so much that a large part of the untreated group commits suicide (Haas, Rodgers, Herman 2014) or seeks treatment illegally or abroad. This makes such a study highly unethical, it would never get the okay from an approvals body!*”

So that leaves us with a much more limited set of options for how we can measure the outcomes of medical transition. These measures, while typically giving us lower quality results, are at least possible to conduct and studies have indeed been conducted with them. The blog lists a few of these options:

● *measure the quality of life of participants before and after sex reassignment surgery (long-term study)*

● *measure the quality of life of participants after surgery and compare them to the average quality of life of transsexuals before surgery (demographics etc. need to be similar)*

● *simply ask transsexuals after surgery whether they feel better (yes, it is that easy!)*

Another issue is that as **we are dealing with a small population here** (trans people make up under 1% of the US population, according to nearly all estimates) and certain subsets of this population, e.g. trans people who haven’t had medical transition or are currently going through it, are particularly hard to reach out to. This is especially true for specific topics like trans people in sports (miniscule number of trans athletes) and in the military, for example. This problem of a small population is usually bridged via [convenience sampling](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_sampling) and in general by [recruiting small samples rather than going through the extra effort to get a large sample](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination), **but this also means that our samples are less useful overall**. These sample issues can hopefully be avoided more in the future as more attention and funding goes towards studying trans issues.

We should absolutely keep an eye out for newer, higher quality research as it comes out. In the meantime, we ought to work with the existing research and acknowledge the limitations that come with it.

# **Social Transition**
**Social transition improves depression, anxiety, and psychological function**

● [Journal of Adolescent Health: Connolly et al. 16](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1054139X1630146X)

○ Analyzes consensus on the effectiveness of **social transition**

○ *“Gender-affirming medical therapy and supported social transition in childhood have been shown to correlate with **improved psychological functioning** for gender-variant children and adolescents.”*

○ **Children who socially transition** report levels of depression and anxiety which **closely match** levels reported by **cisgender children**, indicating social transition massively decreases the risk factor of both.

# **Puberty Blockers**
**Puberty blockers are safe, well-studied, completely reversible, endorsed by credible medical and endocrinological associations, and effective at reducing dysphoria, anxiety, and depression.**

● [Public Broadcasting Service News: Korry 16](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/puberty-blockers-may-improve-mental-health-transgender-adolescents)

○ **Everything you need to know about puberty blockers** 

○ Full-blown puberty is irreversible

○ Taking a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, secretion of the sex hormones can be stopped and the onset of puberty suppressed, so that the body does not develop secondary sex characteristics

○ This has been **done safely for decades** to suppress sex hormones in children who develop too early, a condition known as precocious puberty. **Suppressors have also been used to treat endometriosis, uterine fibroids and prostate cancer.**

○ It was only in 2008 that the **Endocrine Society approved** puberty suppressors as a treatment for transgender adolescents **as young as 12 years old**. The Society, with members in more than 100 countries, has since declared that the intervention appears to be **safe and effective**.  In 2011 the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), also issued Standards of Care for the treatment of patients with gender dysphoria, **which include puberty suppression.**

○ Article on why puberty blockers are prescribed and whether or not they are experimental.

○ *“Puberty delaying medications are currently provided off label to adolescents affected by gender dysphoria and this particular use cannot be investigated by a RCT. We have shown that this **does not mean they are experimental drugs** or are provided experimentally. Whether or not these (or even approved drugs) are ethically prescribed depends on **whether they are likely to serve the patient’s health interests** based on the **evidence available at the time of prescription**.”*

○ **Hormone blockers are not new**

■ *“Since the mid 1990s, puberty delaying medications have been prescribed to some adolescents (not prepubertal children) with severe and persistent gender dysphoria, in cases in which such distress was aggravated by pubertal development.”*

○ Study of **201 kids** between the ages of 12-17 with gender dysphoria

○ Subjects were assessed for psychosocial functioning utilizing the Children’s Global Assessment Scale (CGAS), which indicated positive mental health outcomes after puberty suppression

■ *“The CGAS is one of the most widely used rating scales designed to measure how children and adolescents function psychosocially in daily life”*

○ *“Results from this study indicate that **psychological support is associated with a better psychosocial functioning** in GD adolescents, especially if presenting psychological/psychiatric problems. Moreover, **puberty suppression** was associated with a **further improvement in global functioning**. Finally, global functioning improved steadily over time in GD adolescents receiving both psychological support and GnRHa [blockers]”*

○ Results also showed slightly higher CGAS scores for the sample group that was “immediately eligible” for puberty blockers compared to the “delayed eligible” group that only received psychological support, although with such a small sample size the researchers ultimately consider this difference negligible.

○ A combination of these two approaches enabled subjects to reach levels of psychosocial functioning **comparable to peers**.

## Common Puberty Blocker Myths:
Mostly taken from [here](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.gendergp.com/debunking-the-myths-surrounding-puberty-blockers-trans-kids/)

\1. **CLAIM: “Blockers are harmful to bone density”**

[The Endocrine Society](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-06/tes-mii061513.php) found that medical intervention in transgender adolescents appears to be **safe and effective** and that hormone treatment to halt puberty in adolescents with gender identity disorder **does not cause lasting harm** to their bones.

Some meta-studies which show bone density and bone mineral density aren’t harmed:

● [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6469959/](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6469959/)

● [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6616494/](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6616494/)

\2. **CLAIM: “Young people wouldn’t want to take puberty blockers if they knew the risks”**

[Vrouenraets et al. 16](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4987409/) found that the few negative effects of puberty blockers do not change children’s minds and most adolescents stated that the lack of long-term data did not and would not stop them from wanting puberty suppression. They said that being happy in life was more important for them than any possible negative long-term consequence of puberty suppression.

\3. **CLAIM: “Puberty blockers will give trans kids osteoporosis and make them sterile”**

[Heger et al. 99](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/84/12/4583/2864749) found that long term puberty blocker treatment of precocious puberty girls preserved genetic height potential and improved FH significantly combined with normal body proportions. No negative effect on bone mineral density and reproductive function was seen.

\4. **CLAIM: “Children are too young to know they are trans and are pushed to take blockers by parents / social media / peer pressure”**

There are multiple accounts by parents and older trans people who observe that they/their child knew that they were transgender from a young age – [Here is one such account](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90273278) and [another article explaining how transgender kids aren’t rushed into transitioning](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.thedailybeast.com/its-absurd-to-claim-that-trans-kids-are-being-rushed-into-transitioning). These kids [seem to have a strong identity at a young age](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.pnas.org/content/116/49/24480).

\5. **CLAIM: “It is not ethical to give puberty blockers to transgender children”**

Focusing strictly on the ethicality of puberty blockers, [Giordano argues](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://doi.org/10.1136/jme.2007.021097) that the general improved quality of life, including substantially reduced risk of suicide, outweighs the ethical considerations of disrupting puberty. Puberty blockers can be used to relieve stress from a patient and give them more time to get an accurate diagnosis of the situation, [as was the case here](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s007870050073) - certainly more ethical to go forward with an accurate diagnosis than without one.

\6. **CLAIM: “The neutral decision is to not let minors access puberty blockers”**

● [PHSA](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/www.phsa.ca/transcarebc/child-youth/affirmation-transition/medical-affirmation-transition/puberty-blockers-for-youth): Withholding puberty blockers and hormone therapy is not a neutral option and can result in an increased risk of mental health issues.

● [WPATH](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.wpath.org/media/cms/Documents/SOC%20v7/SOC%20V7_English2012.pdf): Withholding puberty suppression and subsequent feminizing or masculinizing hormone

● therapy is not a neutral option for adolescents.

● [ASOCTG](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.rch.org.au/uploadedFiles/Main/Content/adolescent-medicine/australian-standards-of-care-and-treatment-guidelines-for-trans-and-gender-diverse-children-and-adolescents.pdf): Withholding of gender affirming treatment is not considered the neutral option, and may exacerbate distress in a number of ways including increasing depression, anxiety and suicidality, social withdrawal, as well as possibly increasing chances of young people illegally accessing medications.

● The [scottish gov](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.gov.scot/binaries/content/documents/govscot/publications/foi-eir-release/2020/01/foi-201900010673/documents/foi-201900010673---document-3---puberty-blockers-and-trans-yp---april-2017/foi-201900010673---document-3---puberty-blockers-and-trans-yp---april-2017/govscot:document/FOI-201900010673%2B-%2BDocument%2B3%2B-%2B%2BPuberty%2Bblockers%2Band%2BTrans%2BYP%2B-%2BApril%2B2017.pdf) say its not the neutral option “Withholding puberty blockers and hormone therapy is not a neutral option and can result in an increased risk of mental health issues”
## Case Studies:
These case studies only focus on one person at a time. While they don’t have the statistical validity that a study would have at a larger sample size, it can give us qualitative insight into how these people experience what they go through.

● [Kettenis et al. 11](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10508-011-9758-9.pdf)

○ Dutch trans man who started on puberty blockers at age 13 in 1988. His health and well being was monitored regularly for over 22 years

○ he was well-functioning with no clinical signs of a negative impact of earlier puberty suppression on brain development, metabolic and endocrine parameters, or bone mineral density

● [Cohen-Kettenis 98](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9879847/)

○ Focuses on **one person’s case** in which puberty blockers were used at a young age to relieve pressure from them, give them more time to go through proper psychotherapy, and get a more reliable diagnosis of the situation

○ Demonstrates that **puberty blockers can be used to more to help more accurately diagnose gender dysphoria**

○ This should make puberty blockers an appealing option even to people who accept the science around being transgender but still believe that it’s mostly a trend

# **Prevalence of Discrimination**
**Discrimination against trans people is a real thing and is pervasive in many aspects of society. It’s not something that we can simply ignore when talking about trans people.**

● [European Union LGBT Survey 13](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/eu-lgbt-survey-results-at-a-glance_en.pdf)

○ LGBT folks’ self-reported perceptions of discrimination

○ Regarding trans people, finds **high levels of perceived discrimination across the board**, including:

■ **46%** felt discriminated against or harassed within the past year for being trans

■ **29%** felt discriminated against when it came to looking for employment

■ **70%** hid being trans during schooling before becoming 18 years old

● [Wittle et al. 07](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/www.pfc.org.uk/pdf/EngenderedPenalties.pdf) ([second link](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ilga-europe.org/sites/default/files/trans_country_report_-_engenderedpenalties.pdf))

○ Uses data from **872 respondents** in the UK, which is a large number of respondents compared to most studies on trans people (pg 26)

■ At the time, the most **comprehensive study** on discrimination of trans people (pg 17)

○ There are a number of ‘trigger points’ at which trans people start being discriminated against during their transition, the most common of which is once they come out at work (pg 25-6)

○ Aside from that, there’s a wide variety of ways and places in which trans people are discriminated against

● [Trans Employee Experiences Survey by TotalJobs 2016](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.totaljobs.com/advice/wp-content/uploads/Transgender-employee-experiences-survey-report-2016_Totaljobs.pdf)

○ **Survey of 432 transgender people living in the UK and Ireland, focused on their experiences of discrimination in the workplace**. Methodology made it so that the people who were surveyed had transitioned specifically while working/actively seeking work

○ Quantitative survey results came alongside qualitative ‘further comments’ by some respondents to better explain their experiences

○ General trend in play in which **most transgender employees received some support and acceptance, though with a substantial minority experiencing discrimination**

○ Most discrimination tended to come from fellow employees and customers, not so much management.

# **Impact of Discrimination**
**Suicidality is heavily influenced by bullying, discrimination, and poor treatment. Suicide attempt rates are also far higher among individuals who experience substantial discrimination or harrassment. [The ~40% suicide attempt statistic is often misrepresented](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hL53EbFmjWGeJMYuiN5msDjfjRY35q2K6vi91r0lVjY/edit).**
## Let’s talk about the ~40% suicide statistic first.
What exactly is it referring to?

● **This number usually originates from the [National Transgender Discrimination Survey**](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/resources/NTDS_Report.pdf)**, which found that 41% of respondents had attempted suicide at some point in their lives. **The 41% statistic is one of a range of estimates**. Some people will cite 41%, others 40%, others 50%. Different surveys and studies have gotten different results, [with one review of 21 studies giving back a range between 32% and 50%](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5178031/).

● **This statistic is exclusive to trans people, not the LGBT community at large**. The LGB population doesn’t suffer as much as the transgender population for a number of reasons, e.g. different levels of social acceptance and the additional healthcare burdens that trans people deal with.

● **The statistic refers specifically to suicide *attempts*, not completed suicides**. This is important because very few suicide attempts actually result in a death. Estimates for the general population say that [every 25 attempts results in 1 successful death, and every year around 285,000 people become new survivors of suicide](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://save.org/about-suicide/suicide-facts/). This means that anyone who conflates the 40% attempts statistic with deaths is accidentally inflating the suicide rate by 25x.

So how do people misuse it?

● Some people will argue that the high suicide attempt rate means that being LGBT is unhealthy by its very nature, so we should discourage people from being transgender. **This ‘discourage transness’ argument is contradicted by the very same surveys that found these high attempt rates**, as shown in some of the below source annotations (tldr the same surveys that found 40% also found these numbers were higher for people who experienced more victimization, showing that affirmation rather than discrimination would be more helpful for these people). The ‘discourage transness’ argument also fails at a practical level insofar as curative therapy hasn’t shown itself to be effective yet, often causing more harm than good. [This other section](https://archive.ph/uY9Yr#h.n0hrz62uzsou) and [this doc](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hL53EbFmjWGeJMYuiN5msDjfjRY35q2K6vi91r0lVjY/edit) goes an extra step to show how affirmation, not discouragement, lowers suicide attempt rates.

● Sometimes the argument made is that the high suicide attempt rate proves that transition doesn’t work. However, **this statistic refers specifically to lifetime suicide attempts**, which means that it’s possible most of those suicide attempts could have happened in life **before any transition took place**. If we saw a large number of suicide attempts before transition but much fewer after transition, that would directly contradict the argument being made. Regardless, people making this argument usually fail to actually substantiate any causal connection for transition causing suicides.

● Some people go an extra step and compare trans suicide attempt rates to other oppressed groups, e.g. black people under slavery and jews during the Holocaust. That’s addressed [in this video](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ioc8pLo2uQ). (unfortunately, the video link is down right now)

An extra bit on calculating *successful* suicide rates:

● **Getting data on suicide *attempts* (attempting and failing to kill yourself) is much easier to do than getting data on *successful suicides* (attempting and succeeding)**. This is for a number of reasons:

○ People who attempted but didn’t succeed with a suicide are still alive and thus can be surveyed, so you can reach out to these people and ask about past suicide attempts. You can’t survey people who are dead from suicide.

○ Long-term follow-ups are crucial to understanding successful suicide rates, but long-term follow-ups in general have been harder to come across in the literature on transgender issues, and conducting long-term follow-ups for this population has proven difficult. However, you only need a one-time survey to learn about previous suicide attempts from people who are still alive.

○ It’s next to impossible to gather data on people who believed they were trans but committed suicide before coming out to anyone.

○ Sometimes transgender people commit suicide but due to a lack of an easily-identifiable paper trail on them being transgender (e.g. legal documents weren’t changed to reflect their transgender identity), it’s harder for researchers to identify trans people who committed suicide.

● Nevertheless, **some work has been done to get a better idea of the successful suicide rate**. [This study published in 2020](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7317390/) followed 8,263 Dutch transgender people over a long period of time, and **it found a suicide rate of 0.6%** (buried in the study though, see [table 1](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7317390/table/acps13164-tbl-0001/)). This is obviously a far cry from 40% but is still around 4x higher than the suicide rate of the general Dutch population (the study looked at people who went to an Amsterdam clinic).

○ **Discrimination or mistreatment** in education, employment, housing, health care, in places of public accommodations, or from law enforcement is associated with higher prevalence of suicide thoughts and attempts (**13.4% compared to 6.3%**)

○ Those who reported that their spouses, partners, or children **rejected them** because they are transgender reported **higher prevalence** of **lifetime and past-year suicide attempts** (10.5% compared to 5.1%)

○ Respondents who had been **rejected by their religious communities** or had **undergone conversion therapy** were more likely to report suicide thoughts and attempts (13.1% compared to 6.3%)

○ People who are **not viewed by others as transgender** and those who **do not disclose to others** that they are transgender reported lower prevalence of suicide thoughts and attempts (6.3% compared to 12.2%)

○ The cumulative effect of minority stress is associated with **higher prevalence of suicidality**. For instance, **97.7 percent** of those who had experienced four discriminatory or violence experiences in the past year (being fired or forced to resign from a job, eviction, experiencing homelessness, and physical attack) reported seriously thinking about suicide in the past year and 51.2 percent made a suicide attempt in the past year.

○ **26.3% reported misusing drugs or alcohol**

○ *“After controlling for age, race/ethnicity, sex assigned at birth, binary gender identity, income, education, and employment status, **family rejection was associated with increased odds** of both behaviors. Odds increased significantly with increasing levels of family rejection.”*

# **Impact of Social/Familial Support**
**Family support decreases suicide attempts and drug usage while improving the mental health of trans people.**

# **Chosen Name/Pronoun Usage**
**The use of trans people’s chosen name decreases suicide ideation, severe depression, and suicide attempts**

● [Journal of Adolescent Health: Russell ST, et al. 18](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X\(18\)30085-5/fulltext%23intraref0010a) [(cited)](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.healio.com/psychiatry/sexuality/news/online/%7B4a590883-1cf9-41d2-83d6-d222e613dbfa%7D/risk-for-depression-suicide-drops-when-transgender-youth-use-chosen-names)

○ Compared to those without chosen name usage, trans people with chosen name usage experienced:

■ **71% drop in severe depression**

■ **34% drop suicidal ideation**

■ **65% drop in suicide attempts**

○ Keep in mind that as of 2020, this is the only study available on chosen name usage specifically

Some additional notes:

● If someone were to adopt children, there's no biological basis for calling them that kid's parent, because they're not biologically related. However, there is a social reason and a legal reason to call them that kid's parent -- functionally, they serve the same purpose as any other parent would, so it makes much more sense to call them parents than it does to call them glorified child buyers. Similarly, it doesn't make sense to use he/him pronouns on a trans woman, nor vice versa. If the trans person identifies and passes as being a certain gender, they ought to be treated with the respective pronouns. In most contexts, the ‘trans-cis’ distinction will be about as relevant as the biological-adopted distinction with parents.

● "You don't have to call someone by their preferred pronouns." Yeah and you don't have to flush your poop down the toilet after shitting in a public restroom but it's a respectful thing to do.

# **Bathroom Bills**
**Evidence for the public safety argument in regards to bathroom bills is unsubstantiated in data. Bathroom bills would give rise to other problems which proponents leave unaddressed as well. Also, check out [this resource](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://dynalist.io/d/VuwRennroubDzZWlQrNI-hqO) for additional material on the subject.**

○ **Analysis of crime & privacy violations** in Massachusetts as they relate to concerns raised by those who advocate for ‘**trans bathroom bills**’

○ Analysis indicates there is **no empirical evidence to support these concerns**; such crimes & privacy violations are **exceedingly rare**.

○ Calls for trans bathroom bills are **fearmongering**, plain and simple.

○ To add additional context in the case of Massachusetts, [a different study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26219197/) sampled 452 transgender people in Massachusetts and found that 65% of respondents experienced discrimination/harassment in public accomodations, part of which includes discrimination in bathrooms. This is in spite of the limited anti-discrimination laws that exist in the state. This would suggest that **in Massachusetts, it would be more productive to focus on transgender discrimination than it would be to block them from certain restrooms**.

## Specific Debunks:
Keep in mind that singular incidents don’t actually prove a broader statistical trend, nor do small compilations of incidents.

● [**Colorado high school incident**](https://archive.ph/hIE44) - claimed that a trans woman was harassing other girls in a high school bathroom

○ [Debunk](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://thinkprogress.org/anti-lgbt-group-admits-it-invented-story-about-transgender-student-harassing-classmates-updated-d66f40c01517/) - an interview with the school’s superintendent confirms that this never happened

● [**Joey Salads experiment**](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHt7EBCgJnI) - Salads dresses up how he thinks a trans woman would, and goes into a women’s restroom, receiving negative responses from others in the scene

○ [\[Video\] Debunk](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxoXcQbrGQs) - Salads misrepresented the behaviour of trans women and used a single-person restroom, so his whole experiment was probably staged. A replication of the experiment got no negative responses from others in the scene

● [**Dallas incident**](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.krbcnews.com/dallas-transgender-woman-caught-taking-pictures-of-underage-girls-at-target/) - Trans woman allegedly taking photos of children in women’s restrooms

○ [Debunk](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.krbcnews.com/about/) - the website’s about page says “*And here we are today, to bring you nothing but pure horse shit... This should go without saying, but everything on this website is purely for entertainment purposes. We are in no way affiliated, or trying to look like we are affiliated with any local news station.*”

● [**Casper, Wyoming incident**](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://billingsgazette.com/news/state-and-regional/crime-and-courts/trial-begins-for-casper-resident-charged-with-sexually-assaulting-/article_24fd9634-02a9-5ffa-99b0-a06b4aaff15a.html) - Trans woman, Michelle Martinez, sexually molested 10 yr-old

○ [This actually did happen](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/miguel-martinez-transgender-bathroom-controversy/), but this one incident can’t be extrapolated onto the greater trans population, especially not with the existing empirical evidence regarding bathroom bills

○ This one also happened in a private restroom in someone's home, so that wouldn't have been covered by a restrictive bathroom bill anyway.

● [**Family Research Council compilation**](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://downloads.frc.org/EF/EF16F27.pdf) - cites 25 instances of men going into female bathrooms

○ Most if not all of the stories they cite do NOT involve or even MENTION trans people; this is by-and-large a compilation of CIS men harrassing women

■ While the FRC argues that the problem itself is in fact cis men exploiting a perceived loophole, most of their “examples” lack any connection to bathroom bills regardless.

○ Even if every single incident involved a trans person, this does barely anything to justify bathroom bills. 25 instances over the course of 18 years (1999-2017) is barely anything demonstrative of a larger problem in need of being addressed at a large scale.

○ Most, if not all, of those incidents would be illegal even without a restrictive trans bathroom bill being in effect, so introducing such a law isn’t really the solution here.

○ Gathering this sort of data via media reports is rather dubious too, considering some of these incidents go unreported and some of those which are reported turn out to be hoaxes. It doesn’t help that a good few hyperpartisan and anti-trans advocacy groups are cited, like DailyWire and MassResistance, which both have interest in spreading anti-trans info even if it turns out to be misleading or falsified.

● “[*When is 90% not Substantially ALL?*](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://outofmypantiesnow.wordpress.com/2013/10/28/when-is-90-not-substantially-all/)” TERF wordpress blog

○ Ignoring the preamble, the post is very obviously a gish gallop which has lot of dead links and an awful lot of links unrelated to the transgender bathroom stuff. The compilation also includes way more than just transgender people, extending its focus to cross-dressers (that is, anyone who is wearing literally any clothing which we associate with the opposite gender, such as [a naked man who is wearing nothing but women's heels](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_wires/2007Apr26/0,4675,NothingButHeels,00.html)).

○ Many of these incidents don't even give us evidence that cross-dressing is something the people involved do on a regular basis, e.g. an incident where [a man impersonated a female police officer](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2012/04/police-crossdressing-robber-impersonating-cop.html). We don't know if that person regularly cross-dresses or if the person was impersonating a police officer who just happens to be a woman, but it gets included in the blog's list anyway.

○ The blog even includes incidents where no crime was committed, e.g. [a man who drowned because the skirt he was wearing was too tight to let him swim](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/crossdresser-killed-by-skirt-18076161). How is this an example of a transgender sex crime in a bathroom??
## Other Notes:
● If a man wanted to pretend to be trans as an excuse to rape women, he doesn't have to fake being a woman to go into the bathroom. The law won't physically prevent him from going in there.

● Rape, sexual harassment, and voyeurism are already illegal, so if your primary concern is women being sexually harassed or raped by men in the bathroom, then there's already laws to address your concerns.

● [Even from a conservative perspective](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.nationalreview.com/2016/12/transgender-bathrooms-conservative-defense-transgender-rights/), bathroom bills give an unnecessary amount of power to big government and aren't necessarily effective. It’s not practical for the government to enforce a trans-oriented policy like this because most trans people don't look like their birth sex. The cis man won't present as a woman, just as a trans man wouldn't present as a woman. That would [make it look like a girl is going into the men’s restroom](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.huffpost.com/entry/north-carolina-transgender-tweet_n_56f3f787e4b04c4c3761652b), or vice versa - [memes like this](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/584810436801593433/890247143405813780/229225625_10223771452107032_6267901065728286146_n.png) and [this](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/584810436801593433/892821491027148850/nrdis4wbrT34NY8QCe6-fUjNl1YmTbeEw03c7ikLm7rlpVhts3s1T3YaPRzO7JUQcKmO-FlkGmAVkwOYMcn6plKXOWhzp0hW2NNi.png) carry home the point.

● The burden of proof that transphobes for stuff like this can easily be turned against them. Someone could find several instances of cis people harrassing trans people in bathrooms ([which is far more common anyway](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-lgbt-survey-idUSKBN13X0BK)) but that doesn’t justify banning cis people from their respective bathrooms.

● You don’t want to ask “find me one instance of a bathroom assault”, as you can find one instance of all sorts of unusual things. It’s instead better to ask “show me

○ frequent exposure to negative depictions of transgender people in the media was significantly associated with clinical symptoms of depression, anxiety, global psychological distress, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in this population

○ those who reported greater frequency of exposure to these messages were significantly more likely to exhibit clinical symptoms of depression, anxiety, global psychological distress, and PTSD. The association held even after adjustments were made for variables such as age, race, income, and reported experiences of childhood and/or adult sexual or physical abuse, which suggests that negative media messages may have an independent impact on the mental health of transgender populations exposed to such messages.

Keep in mind that specific instances of trans people winning sports competitions doesn’t actually prove anything about broader trends. Also worth noting the low quality of much of this research because there’s very few trans athletes and nobody cared about this until like 2015, which means we should be open to new research developments for this topic and a lot isn’t settled science yet**

● [Jones et al. 17](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5357259/)

○ Systemic review covering prior research on **trans individuals’ performance in sports** and preexisting **sports policies** concerning trans people, amounting to **8 research articles and 31 sports policies**

○ Finds that “There is no direct or consistent research suggesting transgender female individuals (or male individuals) have an athletic advantage at any stage of their transition”

■ (includes cross-sex hormones, gender-confirming surgery)

○ This particular subject is in need of more and better research because **most research is really low quality**, so using this systemic review as a *definitive* statement on the topic is a dumb thing to do. The systemic review is only as good as the studies it rests on.

■ Much of the **low-quality problem comes from small sample sizes** (you can see sample sizes in [this table](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5357259/table/Tab1/)). **It’s hard to gather a large group of transgender athletes if there are so few in the first place**. To put this into broader context, we are looking at a small portion of the population (trans people), within that group is a small number of athletes, and within that group we have trans athletes who do competitive sports, aka the people we can recruit for our sample. So we’re looking at a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of the population.

■ Because of the lack of good research on the subject, **anti-trans sports policies are likely based on little if any empirical evidence** (very little of that evidence exists).

○ Trans individuals experience **substantial discrimination** from sports institutions due to existing anti-trans policies.

○ “Any athletic advantages a transgender girl or woman arguably may have as a result of her prior testosterone levels **dissipate after about one year** of estrogen therapy”

○ “According to medical experts on this issue, the assumption that a transgender girl or woman competing on a women’s team would have a competitive advantage outside the range of performance and competitive advantage or disadvantage that already exists among female athletes is **not supported by evidence**.”

○ Very clear **emphasis on maximizing both inclusiveness and fairness for athletes**

○ Only restriction in place for trans people is testosterone suppression treatment for transgender women - this policy is meant to preserve fairness in competition while letting trans women participate in their proper sports teams.

○ **The policy pdf goes more in-depth about broader inclusion of trans athletes into sports teams**, suggesting ‘best practices’ for athletics administrators, coaches, etc. That mostly just comes down to standardizing NCAA practice at other schools, educating about non-discrimination laws that apply for sports, and being respectful and understanding towards trans athletes (sportsmanship!)

○ *“It is primarily the **lack of public understanding** regarding transgender people that remains the greatest cause of their exclusion”*, not some preceived advantage among athletes.

○ The study found **interconnecting themes** among all its participants to substantiate the prominence of public exclusion:

■ the impact of alienating **sports experiences** at school

■ the intimidating nature of the **changing room** environment

■ the fear of public space and how this drastically constrained their **ability to engage in sport** and physical activity

■ the overall impact of their exclusion in terms of being denied the **social, health and well-being aspects** of sport

● [Lenzi 18](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2007&context=aulr)

○ **Legal analysis about the legality of transgender sports policy** in the context of Title IX and the 14th Amendment

○ **Broad conclusion in favor of inclusive policy** for trans people, some nuance.

■ There’s different types of trans-affirmative sports policies. States like Connecticut have a **fully inclusive policy** that lets you participate in whatever team aligns with your gender identity. The assumption here is that the very small number of transgender athletes doesn’t pose a significant threat to fairness for cis people. Other states like Idaho and Ohio have a **partially inclusive policy** which basically lets you participate in the team of your gender identity as long as you complete a year of hormone therapy. This restriction is meant to keep sports fair for everyone involved by dealing with biological advantages one group might have over the other.

■ It’s important to note that this conclusion is primarily drawn from legal analysis, working its way through the existing law apparatus that we have in place. **This is meant to provide a solution for trans athletes that is legal**, so the legal prioritization might not be best for a debate about something else, e.g. the *morality* or *impact* of these policies.

○ Throughout the paper Lenzi emphasizes that sex-segregated sports gives cis women a fair chance at being competitive against cis men, as cis men generally have a biological advantage. However, **trans people who have gone through cross-gender hormone therapy are not comparable to their cis counterparts** in the same way.

■ “*Before high school athletic associations devise regulations regarding transgender athletes, they must openly acknowledge the inherent biological differences between males and females. A trans girl, who has a male body that regularly produces testosterone, has a physical advantage over a cis girl whose body produces significantly less testosterone. **However, when a trans girl receives cross-gender hormone therapy, the treatments greatly reduce any former biological edge.** Hormone treatments for MTF trans girls increase body fat, decrease muscle mass, and may even cause a slight loss in height. After only one year of cross-gender hormone therapy, a trans girl will have estrogen and testosterone levels similar to the average cis girl.*”

○ This op-ed specifically focuses on the impact of HRT on trans people’s athletic performance, but from a qualitative POV - a trans woman explaining the experience she went through with HRT impacting her athletic ability

○ This qualitative focus can give us a good perspective on what these trans athletes are going through when they go through HRT

## Other Notes:
**On physiological differences**: segregating sports based on something like height, testosterone, etc can get really messy especially when it’s tied in with the existing sex-segregation in sports. In some cases, this has led to the [outright exclusion of biological females from women’s sports simply due to naturally high testosterone levels](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.axios.com/namibia-disqualified-naturally-high-testosterone-olympic-24d0f1f9-9491-47bb-8c5a-199bf91e6255.html). Some of these policies need to be carefully thought through so as not to accidentally exclude people who really didn’t do anything to deserve it.

**On Fallon Fox/Tamika Brents**: For one, their specific match is pretty much just one match, one data point out of so many other matches and games. This one anecdote is not statistical data and is not generalizable to all trans people in sports (though let’s be real, finding any good statistical data on trans athletes is a challenge). Second, however shocking the concussion and broken skull were, these sorts of traumatic head injuries [are sadly very common in MMA fighting](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/mma-fighters-suffer-traumatic-brain-injury-in-almost-a-third-of-professional-bouts-study), to the point where it’s even been banned in some countries (plus banned and relegalized in others). MMA is a relatively dangerous sport and Tamika Brents’ injuries are unfortunately not particularly out of the ordinary for that sport, so it doesn’t make much sense to hyperfocus on Fox being trans here.

**On general “fairness” args:** The pretty obvious rebuttal is that sex segregated sports does not somehow make everything fair. Some of this is more general (not all players of the same sex have the same testosterone levels) and some of it is specific to the sport (in basketball, taller players have an obvious advantage over shorter players). In the case of basketball, someone who is 6’4” in height has an obvious biological advantage over someone who is 5’4”, however we allow these two players to compete whereas a typical cis man is barred from competing with a typical cis woman because of the man’s biological advantages. The question then comes down to what sort of fairness we want to promote, and for who, as different people benefit from different approaches to fairness in sports. [This article](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.outsports.com/2019/4/11/18296976/trans-athlete-fair-sports-rules-lgbtq-fairness) covers the broader point fairly well.

# **Neurology/Biology**
**Some trans individuals neurologically reflect cisgender people of their desired gender, suggesting a neurological component to their experiences. This suggests that gender has some biological basis, but not necessarily that gender is 100% biological. There’s obviously a sociological basis to gender and gender roles which complement its biological aspects.**

● [European Society of Endocrinology 18](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/05/180524112351.htm)

○ **Brain Scans** show that (many) transgender individuals neurologically reflect their identity, not their assigned gender at birth.

■ The study included both adolescent boys and girls with gender dysphoria and used magnetic resonance imaging (**MRI**) scans to assess brain activation patterns in response to a pheromone known to produce **gender-specific activity**.

■ The pattern of brain activation in both transgender adolescent boys and girls more **closely resembled that of non-transgender** boys and girls of their desired gender.

● [Smith et al. 15](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763415002432)

○ Out of 14 studies of brain structure (total N=307, N MtF=195, N FtM=112) with a total of 23 results: 6 results that trans people had brain structure similarities to their birth sex, 12 results that trans people had brain structure similarities to their gender identity, and 5 results that unclear results (either no significant sex differences or no significant differences between trans and cis participants, or both).

○ **12 of 18 (66%) results** with clear results **suggest trans people have brain structures with similarities to their current gender identity**.

■ Keep in mind that’s no consensus, but it suggests there could be something to check out there

● [Suraswat et al. 15](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://journals.aace.com/doi/abs/10.4158/EP14351.RA)

○ Studies on gray matter, white matter, twins, and prenatal exposure all suggest -- albeit, with limited sample sizes and methods -- that transgender identity, like homosexuality, has a biological origin

○ “*Although the mechanisms remain to be determined, **there is strong support in the literature for a biologic basis of gender identity**.*”

○ “*Current data suggest a biologic etiology for transgender identity. Studies of DSD patients and neuroanatomical studies provide the strongest evidence for the organic basis of transgender identity. **Because the sample sizes of most studies on this subject were small, the conclusions must be interpreted with caution**. Further research is required to assign specific biologic mechanisms for gender identity.*”

# **Detransition/Regret**
**While detransitioning is rare in the first place, it is overwhelmingly driven by various forms of discrimination, not uncertainty with regards to identity. Regret rates are also very low. This seems to be true for both trans adults and trans kids. Credit for most of this stuff goes to [this doc](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KxCxhpj1CAOr8CzWow-rUeBZig6q6n49x3MPdFXhzL8/edit?usp=drivesdk) by [u/Albamc35](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.reddit.com/user/Albamc35/), feel free to cite it for convenience**
## Trans Kids Detransition:
● [Using information from the Australian Court](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://web.archive.org/web/20220313140053/https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/FamCAFC/2017/258.html), 96% of all patients who were assessed and received a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria by the 5th intervenor (the Royal Children's Hospital) from 2003 to 2017 continued to identify as transgender or gender diverse into late adolescence. **No patient who had commenced stage 2 treatment had sought to transition back to their birth assigned sex**.

● [A summarisation on all people treated in Amsterdam from 1972 up to 2015](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29463477/), which treats more than 95% of the transgender population in the Netherlands, found that out of those referred to the clinic in before the age of 18 and treated with puberty blockers, **4 out of 207 trans girls (2%) stopped puberty suppression** without proceeding to HRT and **2 out of 370 trans boys (less than 1%) stopped puberty suppression** without proceeding to HRT

● [A study of 143 youth receiving puberty-blocking medication in the Netherlands](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10508-020-01660-8.pdf) found that 3.5% chose to discontinue puberty blockers without seeking any further transition treatment.

● [A William's Institute report](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/age-trans-individuals-us/) finds that there is **no significant difference between the number of trans teens and the number of trans adults (0.7% and 0.6% respectively)**. The slight decrease in the older age groups could be down to rejection from peers, as [older generations are much less likely to support trans rights than younger people](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Public-Opinion-Trans-US-Aug-2019.pdf).

● [A study published in 2022](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2021-056082/186992/Gender-Identity-5-Years-After-Social-Transition) conducted a long-term followup of 317 trans kids and found that over the course of 5 years, **a resounding 94% of kids kept their trans identity**. Only 2.5% detransitioned back to a cisgender identity.

Also, trans kids are not ‘going through a phase.’ First of all, [an article from a magazine from the American Academy of Pediatrics](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/Pages/Gender-Identity-and-Gender-Confusion-In-Children.aspx) mentions how by age 4, children have a ‘stable sense of their gender identity.’ And a[ study on trans and cis kids](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.pnas.org/content/116/49/24480) ([citied in this Forbes article](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawnstaceyennis/2020/12/29/study-transgender-children-recognize-their-authentic-gender-at-early-age-just-like-other-kids/%231f9d83da526b)) found gender identity — the concept of knowing whether one’s self is male, female or non-binary — is as strong in trans kids as it is among those identifying as cis. Similar results are found [in this study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d642/d3853a04e464d85b629115d7ff513b9da20a.pdf). There’s also a number of [studies which further suggest a neurological or biological component to gender identity](https://archive.ph/uY9Yr#h.ukdf8exks1hw).
## General Detransition:
● [A study on detransition rates in a national UK Gender Identity Clinic](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://epath.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Boof-of-abstracts-EPATH2019.pdf%23page=139) (pg 139) found **out that of the 3398 patients who had appointments during this period, 16 (0.47%) expressed transition-related regret or de-transitioned**. Of these 16, one patient expressed regret but was not considering detransitioning, two had expressed regret and were considering detransitioning, three had detransitioned, and ten had detransitioned temporarily.

○ The reasons stated by patients for their regret or detransition included: social factors, reporting physical complications, and changing their mind about their gender identity and identifying as their gender assigned at birth, which shows that of that minority, alot were not due to releasing they are not trans

● [A transgender mental health survey in the UK](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.gires.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/trans_mh_study.pdf) (pg 66-67) found in terms of social changes that they had made in relation to being trans or transitioning, **only 9% had significant regrets. In regards to the physical changes of being trans, only 2% having major regrets**. Remember that regrets =/= detransition though

● [A massive survey of trans people in the United States](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/usts/USTS-Full-Report-Dec17.pdf) (pg 111) found that even including people who only temporarily detransition either socially or medical (or both), only 8% of respondents reported having de-transitioned at some point.

○ Of these “detransitioners,” **only 5% did it because they realized it was not for them, accounting for a mere 0.4% of the overall sample**.

○ And even then, 62% of those who had de-transitioned reported that they were currently living full time in a gender different compared to the gender they were thought to be at birth.

○ “*The 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey (USTS) is the largest survey examining the experiences of transgender people in the United States, with 27,715 respondents from all fifty states, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and U.S. military bases overseas*”

● [Turban et al. 19](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2749479)

○ Research on 27,715 transgender adults living in the US, 3,869 of whom had been exposed to gender identity conversion efforts

○ They found that quote “***exposure to [gender identity conversion efforts] before age 10 years was significantly associated with several measures of suicidality, including lifetime suicide attempts***”.

○ They also found no significant difference when comparing religious or secular conversion attempts. So it’s not a case of finding the right way to do it, there is no right way to do it.

## SRS Detransition:
● [A study on people who went through sex reassignment surgery in the Netherlands](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15842032/) found that of 162 trans adults, **only 1 reported they would choose not to transition again**. Another had some regrets but would choose to transition again (0.6% regret rate)

● [An analysis of all applications for sex reassignment surgery in Sweden](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24872188/) found that of people undergoing SRS, **regret was about 2.2% and there was a significant decline of regret over time**

● [In this international survey of 46 surgeons](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://journals.lww.com/prsgo/Fulltext/2018/08001/Abstract__A_Survey_Study_of_Surgeons__Experience.266.aspx) (67% of providers have been in practice for greater than 10 years) they were asked to select a range representing the number of transgender patients they have surgically treated, and **this amounted to a cumulative number of approximately 22,725 patients treated** by the cohort.

○ 49% of respondents had never encountered a patient who regretted their gender transition or were seeking detransition care. 12 providers encountered 1 patient with regret and the rest encountered more than one patient. This amounted to a total of 62 patients. There were 13 patients who regretted chest surgery and 45 patients who regretted genital surgery.

○ Overall, only 22 patients (0.1% of the sample) detransitioned because of a change in gender identity

● [A study on 232 trans women who were operated by the same surgeon 'using a consistent technique'](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1024086814364%23page-1) found that **none reported outright regret and only a few expressed even occasional regret**. Dissatisfaction was most strongly associated with unsatisfactory physical and functional results of surgery.

● [An international study on 201 people who had trans-related surgeries](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28471328/) found that **postoperative satisfaction was 94% to 100%**, depending on the type of surgery performed. Only eight (6%) of the participants reported dissatisfaction and/or regret.

● [A study in Belgium of 107 people who underwent SRS](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1158136006000491?via%3Dihub) found none of the patients regretted their surgery.

● [A study of 218 patients in Sweden](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9570489/) found only 3.8% had regretted it. The study also notes that **support from family and friends is a huge factor in reducing regret**. Keep in mind that this data was taken in 1998 during a time in which being trans was less socially accepted than they are now, so that number has evidently decreased over time

● [A study on 66 patients](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11564029/) found none of the present patients claimed to regret their decision to undergo gender-transformation surgery.

● [A ](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://web.archive.org/web/20070812100135/http://www.symposion.com:80/ijt/pfaefflin/6002-6.htm%23Treatment%20Results)[**meta analysis**](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://web.archive.org/web/20070812100135/http://www.symposion.com:80/ijt/pfaefflin/6002-6.htm%23Treatment%20Results), which looked at 74 follow-up studies and 8 reviews of outcome studies, found **over a 30 year period, only 20 MTF and 5 FTM regretted transitioning due to gender identity**. According to [this study that mentions this](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/www.amsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/CareOfThePatientUndergoingSRS.pdf), there were 1000-1600 MTF and 400-550 FTM patients, which equates to regret rates of <1% for FTMs and 1-1.5% for MTFs (page 4).

## What about older studies?
**I will be talking about the studies on trans kids, which are the most quoted I have seen**. One recent example of quotation is in [JK Rowling's essay](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.jkrowling.com/opinions/j-k-rowling-writes-about-her-reasons-for-speaking-out-on-sex-and-gender-issues/):

“*I want to be very clear here: I know transition will be a solution for some gender dysphoric people, although I’m also aware through extensive research that studies have consistently shown that between 60-90% of gender dysphoric teens will grow out of their dysphoria.*”

But there are a number of flaws with these studies. [An analysis of 3 of these studies found this](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://jaacap.org/article/S0890-8567\(15\)00794-7/fulltext) (**I'm quoting, and it's a long quote**):

“*The 3 largest and most-cited studies have reported on the adolescent or adult gender identities of cohorts who had, in childhood, showed gender “atypical” patterns of behavior. Of those who could be followed up, a minority were transgender: 1 of 44, 9 of 45, and 21 of 54. Most of the remaining children later identified as gay, lesbian, or bisexual (although a small number also was heterosexual).*

*However, close inspection of these studies suggests that **most children in these studies were not transgender to begin with**. In 2 studies, a large minority (40 and 25) of the children did not meet the criteria for GID to start with, suggesting they were not transgender (because transgender children would meet the criteria). Further, even those who met the GID diagnostic criteria were rarely transgender. Binary transgender children (the focus of this discussion) insist that they are the “opposite” sex, but most children with GID/GD do not. In fact, the DSM-III-R directly stated that true insistence by a boy that he is a girl occurs “rarely” even in those meeting that criterion, a point others have made. When directly asked what their gender is, more than 90% of children with GID in these clinics reported an answer that aligned with their natal sex, the clearest evidence that most did not see themselves as transgender.*

*We know less about the identities of the children in the third study, but the recruitment letters specifically requested boys who made “statements of wanting to be a girl” (p. 12), with no mention of insisting they were girls. Barring evidence that the children in these studies were claiming an “opposite” gender identity in childhood, these studies are agnostic about the persistence of an “opposite” gender identity into adulthood. Instead, they show that most children who behave in gender counter-stereotypic ways in childhood are not likely to be transgender adults.*”

[**This analysis of 4 of these studies](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15532739.2018.1456390) **found methodological, theoretical, ethical, and interpretive concerns**. Here is their breakdown:

Methodological Concerns

\1. the potential misclassification of child research participants

\2. the lack of acknowledgement of social context for research participants

\3. the age of participants at follow-up

\4. the potential misclassification of adolescent and young adult participants lost to follow-up

Theoretical Concerns

\1. assumptions inherent in“desistance” terminology

\2. binary gender framework

\3. presumption of gender stability as a positive outcome

Ethical Concerns

\1. intensive treatment and testing of child participants

\2. questionable goals of treatment

\3. lack of consideration of children’s autonomy

Interpretive Concerns

\1. the assumption that unknown future adult needs should supersede known childhood needs

\2. the underestimation of harm when attempting to delay or defer transition

Here are the conclusions from [this presentation from a WPATH conference](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://gidreform.wordpress.com/2014/02/25/methodological-questions-in-childhood-gender-identity-desistence-research/) (which is a [reputable organization on gender dysphoria](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.hrc.org/resources/world-professional-association-for-transgender-health-wpath)), which criticizes some of those studies:

\1. Evidence from these studies suggests that the majority of gender nonconforming children are not gender dysphoric adolescents or adults.

\2. It does not support the stereotype that most children who are actually gender dysphoric will “desist” in their gender identities before adolescence.

\3. These studies do acknowledge that intense anatomic dysphoria in childhood may be associated with persistent gender dysphoria and persistent gender identity through adolescence.

\4. Speculation that allowing childhood social transition traps cisgender youth in roles that are incongruent with their identities is not supported by evidence.

\5. These studies fail to examine the diagnostic value of Real Life Experience in congruent gender roles for gender dysphoric children.

I'll also leave some links that you can look at about those poor studies and this topic in general for further reading (most reference some of the studies I have talked about):

# **Canada’s C-16 Bill**
**C-16 is about hate crimes, not pronoun usage. Misgendering doesn’t cross the threshold for being a hate crime in Canada.**

● [The contents of the bill](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://lop.parl.ca/sites/PublicWebsite/default/en_CA/ResearchPublications/LegislativeSummaries/421C16E): “***The bill is intended to protect individuals from discrimination within the sphere of federal jurisdiction and from being the targets of hate propaganda**, as a consequence of their gender identity or their gender expression. The bill adds "gender identity or expression" to the list of prohibited grounds of discrimination in the Canadian Human Rights Act and the list of characteristics of identifiable groups protected from hate propaganda in the Criminal Code. It also adds that evidence that an offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on a person's gender identity or expression constitutes an aggravating circumstance for a court to consider when imposing a criminal sentence.*”

○ Essentially, **hate crimes against people based on gender identity/expression will be treated legally at the same level as other hate crimes**, e.g. racially motivated hate crimes

○ Not once are pronouns or misgendering explicitly brought up in the bill

○ This provides some further clarity on the bill’s purpose: “*The recognition of the rights of gays and lesbians has evolved in some measure through the recognition of the right to be free from discrimination based on sexual orientation. Sexual orientation does not necessarily protect those whose gender does not align with their sex assigned at birth, or who do not consider themselves to fit in with conventional conceptions of gender. **Bill C-16 seeks in part to add the grounds of gender identity and gender expression to broaden the recognition of the rights of other members of sexual minority groups**.*”

● [Torontoist: Cumming 16](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://torontoist.com/2016/12/are-jordan-petersons-claims-about-bill-c-16-correct/)

○ This article includes a legal expert who comments on C-16 and Jordan Peterson’s takes

○ Jordan Peterson, an active critic of C-16, is likely misunderstanding or mischaracterizing the bill

○ **The threshold for a hate crime in Canada is likely too high for misgendering to be considered a hate crime**

● [Canadian Broadcasting Corporation 18](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.cbc.ca/cbcdocspov/features/canadas-gender-identity-rights-bill-c-16-explained)

○ Good brief on what C-16 actually does

○ Bill C-16 added the words “gender identity or expression” to three places:

■ **Canadian Human Rights Act**, joining a list of identifiable groups that are protected from discrimination. These groups include age, race, sex, religion, disability, etc.

■ **A section of the Criminal Code that targets hate speech** — defined as advocating genocide and the public incitement of hatred — where it joins other identifiable groups.

■ **A section of the Criminal Code dealing with sentencing for hate crimes**. If there’s evidence that an offence is motivated by bias, prejudice or hate, it can be taken into account by the courts during sentencing.

○ **Being jailed for repeated misgendering would be very difficult to do** even with C-16 in place
## Specific Debunks:
● **CLAIM: [Father in British Columbia found guilty of ‘family violence’ for misgendering his trans son**](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/24/father-gagged-found-guilty-family-violence-calling-trans-daughter/)**

○ Case was unrelated to C-16 and had far more to it than misgendering

○ The father was actively bringing his trans son’s personal issues to light in public interviews, and brought up personal details during those interviews

○ The father was also actively contributing to worsening the child’s mental health (the son had already attempted suicide in part because of his father, for example)

● **CLAIM: [Anti-gay activist William Whatcott fined $55,000 for misgendering trans activist Morgane Oger**](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/anti-gay-activist-ordered-to-pay-55000-to-b-c-trans-activist-in-fight-over-hateful-flyer)**

○ Unrelated to C-16, dealt instead with section 7 of British Columbia’s [Human Rights Code](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/00_96210_01) (keep in mind C-16 was national legislation, not provincial legislation)

○ Whatcott was spreading anti-trans misinformation in general, specifically targeting Oger who was running for political office at the time and lost by a small margin

○ [Original source](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/www.westcoastleaf.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/58_Oger_v_Whatcott_No_7_2019_BCHRT_58.pdf) in regards to this case, provides more context — C-16 not cited in it, aside from the *Canadian Human Rights Act* being brought up *once* in 104 pages

# **In the Military**
**Transgender people should be allowed to serve in the military. There is a notable lack of evidence for transgender personnel disrupting unit cohesion, and other concerns e.g. costs and deployability disruption aren’t THAT big a deal.**

● ["Assessing the Implications of Allowing Transgender Personnel to Serve Openly" by RAND Corporation, 2016](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1530.html) ([full text pdf](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1500/RR1530/RAND_RR1530.pdf))

○ Study from RAND Corporation about potential impacts of transgender military service. **Covers a LOT of ground over the course of NINE chapters**, including but not limited to:

■ The existing trans military population

■ Their healthcare needs

■ The impact of letting them serve openly

■ DoD policies that would need to be changed to let them serve openly

○ **ON TRANSGENDER MILITARY ESTIMATES**: RAND’s estimates found there are currently 1,320–6,630 active transgender members in the military. This wide range exists in part because of difficulties getting an accurate estimate.

○ **ON TRANSITION-RELATED HEALTHCARE COSTS**: The transition-related healthcare costs would be relatively low for trans people, adding between $2.4m and $8.4m to overall healthcare costs for active service members. That’s a 0.04-0.13% increase in overall costs.

■ Some people might think this is a 0.04-0.13% increase relative to the entire military budget. This is not true. This is not for the overall military budget, but rather for costs specifically **related to healthcare** for **active** service members.

■ It’s important to note that **not all of the trans people in the military actively need funds for medical transition**. In any given year, RAND found that “*Only a subset will seek gender transition–related treatment... between 29 and 129 service members in the active component will seek transition-related care that could disrupt their ability to deploy.*”

○ **ON DEPLOYABILITY IMPACT**: Most issues with non-deployability **come around during medical transition**, mainly in the form of medical leave for having and recovering from transition-related surgeries. This translates to 29-129 people per year getting medical service that could possibly disrupt their ability to be deployed during that mid-transition time period. **RAND does recommend additional mental health screening in the specific context of gender dysphoria**, at least pre-transition. Those who are post-transition are expected to be safely deployed along the same parameters as other service members (for example, other members also get their mental health screened prior to deployment).

○ **ON UNIT COHESION IMPACT**: Impacts on unit cohesion **weren’t found to be a big concern** in the report, going off of results from similar integration efforts in the past, e.g. including women and LGB people. They also took a look at other countries (Australia, Canada, Israel, and the UK) that had included trans people in the military, and found no significant impact on unit cohesion in those countries.

● [Okros & Scott 2014](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.palmcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Transgender-Military-Service-in-Canada.pdf)

○ Study that analyzed the impact of a transgender-inclusive policy on the operational effectiveness of the Canadian military

○ **Used FIVE different methods to try and find any negative impacts**, e.g. interviews of military experts, people with personal experience, media reports, etc

○ **Found NO evidence whatsoever that the military’s operational effectiveness suffered** from the trans-inclusive policy

● [Williams Institute, 2014](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/trans-military-service-us/)

○ Study that tries to estimate the number of military servicemembers and veterans that are transgender

○ Came out with a rather high estimate of 15,500 active servicemembers who are transgender, and around 134,300 transgender people who either are serving or have served in the military before. **This translates to around 20% of the transgender population having served in the military at some point**.

■ For reference, **only around 10% of the general population has served in the military at some point**, active and veterans included.

○ This should emphasize the importance of the discussion around trans people in the military, as so many trans people have gone through it. A ban from the military could have a serious impact on the transgender community.

**Brief note on surveys that ask servicemembers how they would feel about a trans military ban: this data isn’t actually useful**. Due to the politically charged nature of the topic, responses may not have reflected actual experiences within the military or whatnot, [but instead may reflect the political affiliation of respondents](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.palmcenter.org/blog_posts/in-polling-context-is-everything/). This could make this source useless as a result. This is something I saw in two studies.

● [This study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://dworakpeck.usc.edu/sites/default/files/2020-10/Dunlap%20Holloway%20Pickering%20et%20al.pdf) set out to **survey a diverse group of active duty, cisgender servicemembers** and found that overall, 66% supported transgender inclusion into the military. This differed between subsets of the surveyed group. For example, 82% of LGB servicemembers supported transgender service while only 57% of heterosexual ones did. While this study didn’t explicitly ask about political leanings (e.g. right wing, liberal, etc) **the results do fall in line a way with how these demographics typically fall politically** - LGB people are more liberal and thus more opposed to the ban, heterosexual people tend to be more distributed across both parties and as a result are more split half-and-half in the survey results. **This would suggest that certain demographic characteristics correlate with political leanings, which in turn predict people’s stances on these political issues**.

● [This study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0095327X15575278) surveyed a group of mostly conservative ROTC cadets and Academy cadets and found that a significant portion of them supported a transgender ban in the military. Their typical respondent was “*at a military academy, male, white, nineteen or younger, leaning politically to the right, Christian, and in their first (freshman) year of college.*” The study also found that “*Although cadet attitudes on the surface appear generally negative toward transgender people, **the findings have more to do with context, sex, political, and religious beliefs** than military culture and affiliation exclusively.*” **This means that their beliefs about the transgender military ban were better explained by their politics than by their military experience**.

If we do want to make a policy decision based on this, though, we could definitely consider improving unit cohesion by decreasing transphobic beliefs in the military, as more transphobic people seem to have more concerns about not being able to work with a trans person.
## Trump transgender military ban:
● ["DoD’s Rationale for Reinstating the Transgender Ban Is Contradicted by Evidence" by the Palm Center, 2018](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.palmcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Transgender-troops-are-medically-fit-1.pdf)

○ **This was specifically written in response to [a report published to justify the Trump administration’s transgender military ban**](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.lambdalegal.org/sites/default/files/legal-docs/downloads/dkt._216-2._dod_report_and_recommendations_feb_20181.pdf)**, so it’s specifically responding to the reasoning made for that ban.

■ Something worth noting is that this DoD Rationale [may have been directed by explicitly right-wing, anti-trans activists like Ryan Anderson, Mike Pence, and Tony Perkins](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/03/trumps-new-trans-troops-ban-is-still-unconstitutional.html). This makes the DoD’s rationale less reliable as it may have been influenced by agenda-driven actors who are willing to manipulate the evidence to achieve a certain end.

○ **The DoD report starts out with clearly unreasonable assumptions**, mainly that [gender transition isn’t particularly effective](https://archive.ph/uY9Yr#h.smfvmw6wf1x5). Of course, **this position goes against nearly all of the existing academic literature** and so the DoD report has to cherry-pick 4 studies which still backfires. From the Palm Center critique: “*Yet DoD’s findings rely on a selective reading of scholarship. Despite decades of peer-reviewed research, the Implementation Report could identify only four studies to sustain its conclusion. Critically, even these four studies, supposedly representing the best evidence documenting the uncertainty about transition-related care’s efficacy, all conclude that such care mitigates symptoms of gender dysphoria.*”

○ The Palm Center argues that **the transgender ban would create a double standard for transgender people rather than have everyone working along the same medical, fitness, and deployability standards**, an approach which weakens the legitimacy of the existing military standards and serves to single out transgender people in a discriminatory way.

○ The Palm Center also argues that **most trans troops are medically fit, using the DoD’s own data to carry home the point**: “*Out of 994 service members diagnosed with gender dysphoria in FY2016 and the first half of 2017, 393 (40 percent) deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, or Operation New Dawn. Exactly one individual deploying with a diagnosis of gender dysphoria was unable to complete the deployment for mental health reasons since policy protecting transgender personnel from arbitrary dismissal was established in June 2016.*”

○ The **transgender ban rationale has certain double standards when it comes to suicide attempts**, arguing that the high suicide attempt rate for transgender people should bar them from service while similar high-risk groups oftentimes go ignored, e.g. children of service members (who have a 50% higher suicide attempt rate than the general population). The rationale makes further mistakes with the use of suicidality in its reasoning, and of course fails to account for the fact that **stigmatization of trans people (e.g. banning them from the military) has a negative impact on suicidality**.

○ On the topic of unit cohesion, **the DoD Rationale provides no actual real-life evidence that trans inclusion would harm cohesion**, instead only providing a handful of hypotheticals. These hypotheticals are dubious in and of themselves and aren’t enough to properly argue that trans people hurt unit cohesion.

○ In general, **the Rationale fails to consider opposing viewpoints, mainly by failing to address potential downsides of a ban or considering possible missed benefits from inclusion**. The Rationale is not a balanced, fair approach at the topic, but a one-sided approach which ends up ignoring valid points which oppose the conclusion they want.

○ Explains that **being trans and/or having gender dysphoria aren’t mental illnesses in themselves**, and that mischaracterizing these as a mental illness is wrong in a number of ways:

■ Properly reflect what it means to be transgender and rightfully shift the troubles specific to gender dysphoria towards gender dysphoria rather than transness as a whole

■ Better guide medical researchers, policymakers, and the public regarding proper understanding of what it means to be transgender and how to apporach those issues

■ Reduce the potential for unjustified stigmatization/discrimination of trans people

# **Addressing Reactionary Claims**
Some claims about trans people are addressed in [this doc](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cx2skhMH-WhVi0VmoW-TQfZ-hbOBupAnsREmZfSAAoI/edit) by [this person](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrtaDFiK6Z-v0hqf3sNWhtA), if you want to take a look. [This webpage](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://transgendersg.com/myths/) and [this](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://transgendersg.com/trans-101-faq/) also have a lot of material to work with. Certain myths, e.g. those about [detransition](https://archive.ph/uY9Yr#h.4wru1gwat4vx), the [40% suicide statistic](https://archive.ph/uY9Yr#h.khgue4tu6hz6), and [puberty blockers](https://archive.ph/uY9Yr#h.34nre2pkc7w8), have been addressed elsewhere in this doc.

WIP section but will probably cover:

\- Mia Forstater and JK Rowling controversies

\- The claim that trans people reinforce gender stereotypes

**Q: What about the failed [David Reimer case study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer), which was led by [John Money](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Money), who [introduced the gender-sex distinction](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://scihub.wikicn.top/10.1023/B:ASEB.0000014323.56281.0d)? Doesn’t this failure not only suggest that his gender-sex distinction is flawed, gender roles are tied to nature rather than nurture, and that trans people by extension can’t change their nature via transition?**

● It’s highly encouraged that you read about the experiment and Reimer’s life before trying to refute claims made about them. His [wikipedia page](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer) is a good start, but there are a number of other [biographies](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/david-reimer-and-john-money-gender-reassignment-controversy-johnjoan-case) and [articles](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://slate.com/technology/2004/06/why-did-david-reimer-commit-suicide.html) about him which could be worth reading through as well.

● The David Reimer case is tragic and Money should never have experimented with Reimer in the ways he did. Money covered up the negative results of the experiment for years. There is no reason to defend the ethicality of this whatsoever.

● This does not properly represent the situation with trans people today, however. **Reimer was forced into a girl's gender roles** at a young age and was given hormones basically at birth, unlike cases nowadays where **trans people actively want to transition** rather than being forced into such. Reimer’s case applies best to people who are forced into transitioning despite not wanting it.

○ If anything, the Reimer case undermines anti-trans activists insofar that **it shows the harmful impacts of being forced to live under a gender identity you didn’t choose for yourself**. In this case, we see Reimer, a cis man, suffer from being forced into a trans identity against his will. **This exact same situation could apply to a trans person being forced into a cis identity** against their will - you just swap “cis” and “trans” with each other.

○ The comparison of Reimer to trans people today is further strengthened in that **Reimer basically had gender dysphoria as a woman**, which is described in depth [in his long-term follow-up with Milton Diamond in 1997](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/1961to1999/1997-sex-reassignment.html):

■ “*There were little things from early on. I began to see how different I felt and was, from what I was supposed to be. But I didn't know what it meant. I thought I was a freak or something; … I looked at myself and said I don't like this type of clothing, I don't like the types of toys I was always being given, I like hanging around with the guys and climbing trees and stuff like that and girls don't like any of that stuff. I looked in the mirror and sees my shoulders are so wide, I mean there is nothing feminine about me. I'm skinny, but other than that, nothing. But that is how I figured it out. [I figured I was a guy] but I didn't want to admit it, I figured I didn't want to wind up opening a can of worms.*”

■ “*Joan was put on an estrogen regimen from the age of 12 years but rebelled against taking the hormones. They made her "feel funny" and she didn't want to feminize. She would often dispose of her daily dose. She unhappily developed breasts but wouldn't wear a bra. Things came to a head at the age of 14. In discussing her breast development with her endocrinologist she confessed "I suspected I was a boy since the second grade".*

● This specific case doesn’t really disprove anything about [the gender-sex distinction](https://archive.ph/uY9Yr#h.9a00yzaqmnp8), and the distinction has been validated by further research showing that your biological sex and gender identity don’t always align normally. This experiment is far better for proving the existence of gender being rooted mostly in nature, a statement which might not even conflict with the concept of trans people (assuming their [transgender identity also has neurological/biological basis](https://archive.ph/uY9Yr#h.ukdf8exks1hw)). In fact, **the primary focus of Money’s experiment was on the nature-nurture question**, not on if a gender-sex distinction was useful. Just because Money, a bad person, introduced the distinction, that does not automatically make the distinction useless or bad.

○ **The gender-sex distinction is actually helpful for analyzing the Reimer experiment**. Here, we see that he has a male **biological sex**, yet is forced into the **gender identity** of a woman. The sex-gender distinction is pretty clearly in play with this analysis, proving itself to be useful.

**Q: Why didn’t the medical community change courses on anything or drop any bad ideas after the Reimer experiment went wrong? Doesn’t that indicate corruption and a leftist agenda?**

● Part of why the medical community didn’t change in response to the bad results sooner is because those bad results were covered up by Money for years. [John Money boasted that his experiment had been a success](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://reason.com/2004/05/24/the-death-of-david-reimer/) and the medical community accepted what he said as true for years, until David Reimer collaborated with Dr. Milton Diamond and, in 1997, [published a long-term follow-up for Money’s earlier experiments](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/1961to1999/1997-sex-reassignment.html) which rebutted Money’s research and got worldwide attention. Only then was the truth about Money’s experiment actually available to the medical community for them to actually make changes in response to.

● Once the medical community was aware of the truth, changes were made though. This case, which was mainly focused on the nature-nurture question and gender plasticity, opened up that discussion while severely undermining the “it’s mostly nurture” side of the aisle. It also led to medical reforms on the issue of sex reassignment surgery for infants with certain defects (e.g. micropenis). You can read more about that specifically [here, in the Social Impact section](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/t-vox.org/history/people/david-reimer).

**Q: What if I identify as an attack helicopter, or as a different age? Should I be given the same respect in my identity as trans people want for themselves?**

● This is a false analogy on its face, helicopters and different ages are not analogous to gender identity; helicopters aren’t even socially constructed ([while gender is](https://archive.ph/uY9Yr#h.9a00yzaqmnp8)) and age, while being a social construct (humans constructed the measurement of time via years, months, etc), is not tied to the certain behaviors or identification of a person like gender is.

● The comparison made implicitly assumes that men and women are about as different as humans are to helicopters, which is clearly a bad analogy to use here. As it turns out, men and women are both human and share a lot beyond that while helicopters aren’t even sentient.

● This started out as a dumb joke, and isn’t well-equipped at all to be an actual argument. Anyone who uses this as a legitimate argument has no idea what they’re talking about.

● [This page](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://transgendersg.com/trans-101-faq/) gives a different approach to the attack helicopter arg

**(WORK IN PROGRESS) Q: What if I identify as an attack helicopter, or as a different age? Should I be given the same respect in my identity as trans people want for themselves?**

● There’s a couple things implied with this argument, which we’ll refute here.

○ **Certain things don’t fit within the parameters of gender identity/expression (e.g. identifying as an attack helicopter because attack helicopter is a gender or the sort)**. Gender expression deals specifically with how a person chooses to express themselves within society as a human being. Gender does NOT deal with whether people are human, dogs, attack helicopters, etc.

■ People already recognize this insofar as they know being a human, dog, cat, etc. is different from being a boy or a girl. Masculine dogs exist alongside feminine dogs, and these dogs are able to present themselves as masculine and feminine while still being dogs. Heck, sometimes people even apply gender identificative terms to inanimate things, e.g. countries (“Mother Russia” or the “Fatherland” for Germany) and referring to war ships in a feminine way ([which is a traditional thing to do, not a new SJW soyface thing](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/why-do-ships-have-a-gender)).

○ Some people will argue “if I can identify or express myself as a woman, why can’t I express myself as being a different age or height or whatever?” These people don’t know that **the parameters of gender identity/expression don't necessarily apply to other things (e.g. age or height)**.

**Q: What about [Ray Blanchard](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Blanchard)’s theory of [autogynephilia](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanchard's_transsexualism_typology%23Autogynephilia), the idea that most or all trans women are trans because of erotic arousal by the thought of being a woman?**

● Most evidence supporting the theory was published by Blanchard himself prior to 2003, after which his theory and methodology were both criticized

**Q: People with [anorexia](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia_nervosa) are treated with psychiatric help, not hormones or surgery. Why can’t we do the same for trans people?**

● There’s a crucial set of differences between people with anorexia and those with gender dysphoria.

○ People with anorexia are wrong from the outset when they assume they are overweight, when they’re not. When a person with gender dysphoria thinks they don’t pass as their desired gender, they’re usually not wrong at all, especially if they haven’t gone through any sort of transition to their desired gender yet.

○ Anorexic people usually respond well to psychiatric treatment, whereas the similar curative/conversion therapy option for trans people has yet to emerge as a successful treatment. As for affirmation, trans people [respond well to affirmation](https://archive.ph/uY9Yr#h.smfvmw6wf1x5) whereas affirming anorexic people’s beliefs don’t lead to good results (and any good results from starving an underweight person are probably outweighed by convincing them they’re not overweight to begin with).

● Some people cite [body dysmorphic disorder](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_dysmorphic_disorder) instead of anorexia specifically. The same basic framework applies between anorexia and BDD.

● While gender dysphoria and BDD/anorexia are not really comparable in the way of treatments, it’s important to note that [they can happen in relation to each other](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://centerfordiscovery.com/blog/gender-dysphoria-body-dysmorphia-trans-non-binary-folks/). For example, someone who is very conscious about their body image due to dysphoria might develop BDD as a result of that anxiety. However, that doesn’t justify approaching both gender dysphoria and BDD with the same treatments.

● This talking point is addressed [here](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://transgendersg.com/trans-101-faq/) as well

**Q: Don’t you need dysphoria to be trans?**

Similar to the [gender-sex distinction](https://archive.ph/uY9Yr#h.9a00yzaqmnp8), the answer to this question largely comes down to semantics. It also comes down to whether or not some trans people have managed to get rid of their dysphoria. Let’s start with the semantic aspect. Below are a number of medical organizations cited where they implicitly or explicitly say that not all transgender people have to deal with gender dysphoria:

|**Organization**|**Quote**|
| :-: | :-: |
|[American Psychiatric Association](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/expert-q-and-a)|**Not all transgender people suffer from gender dysphoria** and that distinction is important to keep in mind. Gender dysphoria and/or coming out as transgender can occur at any age.|
|[World Health Organization’s ICD-10](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://icd.who.int/browse10/2016/en%23F64.0)|A desire to live and be accepted as a member of the opposite sex, **usually** accompanied by a sense of discomfort with, or inappropriateness of, one's anatomic sex, and a wish to have surgery and hormonal treatment to make one's body as congruent as possible with one's preferred sex.|
|[American Psychological Organization](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.apa.org/topics/lgbtq/transgender)|Many transgender people **do not experience their gender as distressing or disabling**|
|[American Academy of Pediatrics](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.aappublications.org/news/2018/09/17/transgender091718)|**Some** youths experience gender dysphoria when the incongruence between assigned sex at birth|
|[Canadian Paediatric Society](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://caringforkids.cps.ca/handouts/behavior-and-development/gender-identity)|**Some transgender children experience no distress about their bodies**, while others may express significant discomfort.|
|[World Medical Association](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-statement-on-transgender-people/)|The WMA asserts that gender incongruence is not in itself a mental disorder; **however it can lead to discomfort or distress**, which is referred to as gender dysphoria (DSM-5).|
|[World Professional Association for Transgender Health](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://wpath.org/newsroom/medical-necessity-statement)|The various The DSM-5 descriptive criteria for gender dysphoria were developed to aid in diagnosis and treatment to alleviate the clinically significant distress and impairment that is **frequently, though not universally**, associated with transsexual and transgender conditions.|
([png image for above table, for easy reference](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/624269507745153025/745277589127561406/full_info.png))

If that’s not convincing, let’s go on to that second part: if you have a transgender person who used to have dysphoria, but has now gone through so-and-so procedures and now feels in line with their body, no longer feels dysphoric... is that person no longer transgender? Obviously not. So that again goes to show that you can be transgender without necessarily having dysphoria.

**Q: Doesn’t transition sterilize trans people?**

Not always. It depends on the aspects of transition someone chooses to go through - for example, an FTM trans man who goes through HRT will not go sterile, but he will go sterile if he goes through a hysterectomy (surgical removal of the womb). In fact, [there is documented evidence of trans men going through pregnancy](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Abstract/2014/12000/Transgender_Men_Who_Experienced_Pregnancy_After.9.aspx) (this means they’re not sterile), a majority of whom had been on testosterone. It’s worth noting that [some countries do not offer legal recognition to trans people unless they are sterilized](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://tgeu.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/MapB_TGEU2019.pdf), which is discriminatory and [against human rights law](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://ijrcenter.org/2019/03/21/forced-sterilization-as-a-human-rights-violation-recent-developments/).
## Specific Studies and Articles:
● [Dhejne et al. 11](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016885)** (sometimes referred to as the Sweden study), study name “*Long-Term Follow-Up of Transsexual Persons Undergoing Sex Reassignment Surgery: Cohort Study in Sweden*”

○ **Commonly cited by anti-trans activists to indicate sexual reassignment surgery harms trans people, increases risk of suicide.**

○ This is **NOT** what the study says

■ A study proving that SRS harms trans people would compare the wellbeing of post-SRS trans people to pre-SRS trans people, but this one uses **CIS** people as a control group. Because of this, we can only use the data to compare certain trans people to the cis population - we can’t compare pre-SRS to post-SRS with this data.

■ An excerpt from the study - “*no inferences can be drawn as to the effectiveness of sex reassignment as a treatment for transsexualism. In other words, **the results should not be interpreted such as sex reassignment per se increases morbidity and mortality**. Things might have been even worse without sex reassignment.*”

■ The study merely demonstrates that trans people who have had SRS **still are a vulnerable population** compared to cis people, but NOT that their condition had been worsened by SRS.

○ The head author, Cecilia Dhejne, is actually very trans positive herself, and describes her intent in publishing this study in [this Reddit AMA](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/6q3e8v/science_ama_series_im_cecilia_dhejne_a_fellow_of/dkuk2tr?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x). She also clarifies what the study says in [this interview](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.transadvocate.com/fact-check-study-shows-transition-makes-trans-people-suicidal_n_15483.htm).

■ From the Reddit AMA: “*I have said many times that the study is not design to evaluate the outcome of medical transition. It DOES NOT say that medical transition causes people to commit suicide.*”

■ From [a different published work by Dhejne directly summarizing the study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://openarchive.ki.se/xmlui/handle/10616/45580): “*This study cannot determine the effectiveness of gender-affirming medical intervention*”

○ On top of all of this, [a different study also focused on Sweden](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-009-9551-1) reaffirmed that SRS leads to satisfaction in the long run (though this one had 5 years of data while the Dhejne study had 20 years). [A different study, also conducted in Sweden and with Dhejne as the lead author](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-014-0300-8), found that the regret rate for transitioning was a measly 2.2%

○ Something important to note about the time period of this study is that **societal attitudes toward transgender people may have changed during the study’s timeframe**, between 1973 and 2003. The same is true for transgender healthcare itself. This means that the outcomes of transitioning in 1970 could very well differ from the outcomes of transition in 1990.

■ “*In accordance, the **overall mortality rate was only significantly increased for the group operated before 1989**. However, the latter might also be explained by improved health care for transsexual persons during 1990s, along with altered societal attitudes towards persons with different gender expressions.*”

○ This study is also cited to prove that “trans women retain male pattern violence” and was misrepresented so much that the author herself had an interview to discuss how that's not what the study is saying. [This article by Gemma Stone](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://medium.com/@notCursedE/do-trans-women-retain-male-pattern-violence-df67954373fd) goes over this specific talking point.

There’s so many ways in which this study is wrong and so many rebuttals of the study that rebutting it has become a dead horse at this point.

○ **Commonly cited by anti-trans activists to indicate transness spreads socially, that exposure to trans material might encourage youth to be trans. “Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria” (ROGD).**

○ **The polls were taken on sites which were biased by nature** - ‘*4thwavenow, transgendertrend, youthtranscriticalprofessionals*’. Parents who frequent these sites will have already been conditioned to doubt their kids’ trans identity, so will be much more likely to subscribe to ROGD as a justification for their beliefs. **This is already reason enough to dismiss the study as a proof of ROGD** - it’s hard to get any reliable conclusions out of bad data.

■ On top of this, **the study specifically targeted parents who would fit the ROGD hypothesis**, reaching out to “[*parents of teens who became convinced they were the opposite sex after a steady diet of social media and/or peer influence*](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://4thwavenow.com/2016/07/02/rapid-onset-gender-dysphoria-new-study-recruiting-parents/)”. This sample was probably recruited with intent to prove that ROGD is a big thing, or at the very least to prove that gender dysphoria is a social contagion.

■ It also doesn’t help that the idea for ROGD [first surfaced via these specific websites](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://juliaserano.blogspot.com/2019/02/origins-of-social-contagion-and-rapid.html) (though Littman popularized the term “Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria”) and not from previous scientific inquiry (Littman’s study was the first one ever on ROGD!), which further suggests that these specific websites were hand-picked by Littman to prove a specific hypothesis.

○ Furthermore, **the study polled parents instead of children, which makes the data even less reliable**. While polling parents isn’t always a bad thing, it really undermines this particular study for a number of reasons:

■ Parent evaluations vs children self-evaluations tend to differ substantially when it comes to mental health, and is even more an issue when the parents are stressed about it ([as detailed here in the 4th paragraph](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0212578)). Parents of trans kids who frequent websites about a “transgender craze” going down are probably going to be stressed because they’ll think their kid is involved in this craze.

■ **What appears to a parent to be a “rapid” onset may not have been rapid for their child at all**, as closeted LGBTQ children tend to stay closeted for a while before coming out (they still fear [discrimination/rejection by their family](https://archive.ph/uY9Yr#h.agcl0vdpee8o), among other things) and during this time they’ll get a better sense of their gender identity or sexual orientation. When a gay or trans person comes out of the closet to their parents, what the kids had to process over the course of months or years is processed by parents over the course of mere days - so what looks like a rapid change to parents could easily be anything but rapid to trans children.

○ Even if we are dealing with something which is genuinely rapid-onset, not just from the parent’s view but also from the child’s, this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. [To quote from Julia Serano](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://juliaserano.medium.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-rapid-onset-gender-dysphoria-1940b8afdeba): “***There is nothing inherently erroneous or illegitimate about a “rapid” onset of gender dysphoria** — some trans people experience an epiphany during which all the clues and puzzle pieces suddenly come together, and they finally realize that they are transgender.*” This just goes further to show that the element of social contagion still might not be supported by this study, even if we assume the data is 100% accurate.

○ Multiple other important critiques are made [here](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-019-1453-2) if you want a look, this gives a lot more insight into how Littman’s study is flawed (including criticism of the DSM-5 model used).

○ **“But, the study got censored and suppressed by the activist left! Even disregarding flaws, doesn’t that suggest a biased academia?”**

■ The study was never even pulled from the journal it was published in, despite its many flaws; [it’s still there and available in full](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202330). That’s not suppression and that’s not censorship.

■ As for the Brown University press release on the study, **it was retracted not due to a political agenda but because of concerns raised about the study quality and design** - which definitely exist for this study. Suppressing a *press release* (not the actual study) on a badly designed, fatally flawed study is not a bad thing to do. See the “Expanded Brown University Statement – Tuesday, Sept. 5, 2018” linked [here](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.brown.edu/news/2019-03-19/gender).

■ Regardless, there’s been a good amount of debate on the merits of Littman’s study. A good example of this in play would be [from](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://juliaserano.medium.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-rapid-onset-gender-dysphoria-1940b8afdeba) [this](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/gdworkinggroup.org/2018/08/27/response-to-julia-seranos-critique-of-lisa-littmans-paper-rapid-onset-gender-dysphoria-in-adolescents-and-young-adults-a-study-of-parental-reports/) [back-and-forth](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://medium.com/@florence.ashley/a-little-less-conversation-a-little-closer-reading-please-on-dangelo-and-marchiano-s-response-to-10e30e07875d) about the study. Keep in mind that [criticizing a study isn’t the same as trying to censor it](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/08/rapid-onset-gender-dysphoria-study-criticism-is-not-censorship-its-good-science.html).

○ **“But, the study also found that kids going through ROGD also consumed a lot of trans media and/or had trans friends! Doesn’t that suggest social contagion?”**

■ You could just as easily suggest that the situation is actually flipped - **it makes sense for a closeted person with gender dysphoria to seek out other people with gender dysphoria**, rather than vice versa. Marginalized groups of people tend to seek out one another to get advice or feel comforted by someone whose experiences they can relate to. This applies to a trans person who is closeted (in which case the parents wouldn’t know their kid was trans until the kid comes out as trans). In fact, it’s well documented that gay people reach out to gay communities for help going out of the closet, as it is for people of various political ideologies when they deal with coming out to their loved ones (most commonly a conservative coming out to their liberal family or vice versa). This same sort of process happens with trans people and trans communities.

○ **The study claims that hormonal therapy does not help reduce testosterone levels to that of a cis woman’s**

○ However, the study uses the testosterone blocker known as Spiro, which inhibits testosterone receptors rather than stopping its production, making the data useless. On the other hand, [a different study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15476439/) ([non-paywall](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://eje.bioscientifica.com/downloadpdf/journals/eje/151/4/425.pdf)) using Cypro (a testosterone blocker that actually lowers testosterone in the blood) shows testosterone levels lower than average female levels. This doesn’t mean that HRT doesn’t reduce testosterone, but only that a certain form of HRT isn’t that effective.

○ **Commonly cited by anti-trans activists in order to try and prove the false claim that puberty blockers are harmful**

○ The girl in the article had precocious puberty (puberty starting too early), which can be dangerous if untreated

○ The effects cited are common from using the medication for too long and or using the wrong dose, meaning its the fault of the doctor and not the medication

○ The article does not prove puberty blockers are bad, it proves doctors need to do better

○ The study is not peer reviewed despite how long its been up

○ Bad methodology: the study doesn’t take into account outside influence on muscle mass such as manual labor or exercise neither pre hrt nor during the treatment, which can provide a big starting point regardless of sex hormones, Something which compares trans athletes and trans people who aren't as active would provide more accurate data

○ Big conservative bias with a conspiracy theory and very incorrect use of words in the first paragraph

○ The study did not talk about trans women at all, it talked only about suppressing testosterone without introducing cross sex hormones

○ This study is taken completely out of context and doesn't prove anything about trans women.

○ The rest of the article draws conclusions from that ONE study that doesn't even prove the point they try to make and makes it seem like that's all science has to offer.

○ **Cited by anti-trans activists to indicate that gender inclusion policies in store changing rooms leads to a large increase in sexual offences**

○ **BAD DATA COLLECTION:** The study uses **media reports from Google searches**, which is a horrific way to collect data on actual sexual offences.

■ If a single incident gets reported on by multiple outlets, that may have been counted as multiple incidents by the study.

■ The amount of reporting on these incidents in Target stores may have had an uptick after the policy was passed as more people were interested in those particular sorts of incidents.

○ **Most cases recorded [in the database](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oju2lck3TJVFKTAm7neinY7-tq1fQfS3IhPOyvqq3Kw/edit%23gid=302670011) did not even take place in the changing rooms or bathrooms**, which is what the [gender non discriminatory policy](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://corporate.target.com/article/2016/04/target-stands-inclusivity) affected, but rather the store floor (using ctrl + f, there were 17 mentions of ‘washroom,’ 50 mentions of ‘changeroom,’ and 155 mentions of ‘store’ (as in store floor) on the database).

○ Despite the vast majority of upskirt incidents happening on the store floor (97.1%), with, again, store floors not being affected by the policy, and the vast majority of peeping tom incidents happening in changing rooms and bathrooms (98.4%), **both went up by almost the exact same rate**: *‘In a Poisson regression, using trimesters to control for seasonal variations in offenses,the fold change in rate from the four year pre-policy period to the post-policy period was 3.03 for Upskirt and 3.14 for Peeping Tom.’* This means **the policy can explain almost none of the rise in these cases**, but rather most likely the methodology (as it relies only on media reports). **And these numbers are from the study itself**!

○ It is not peer reviewed and published on *Woman Means Something*, a TERF website.

○ The study’s author is a [pastor who supports gay conversion therapy](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/author/paul-dirks/), showing further study bias - people who are anti LGB are very likely to also have conservations about the T

○ Anyway, [there is a large consensus](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/www.4vawa.org/ntf-action-alerts-and-news/2018/4/12/national-consensus-statement-of-anti-sexual-assault-and-domestic-violence-organizations-in-support-of-full-and-equal-access-for-the-transgender-community) of US sexual assault charities that have come forward in support of trans-inclusive policies

○ Most of these studies are grossly out of date, with only 4/11 of them being from after 1990. That means that most of the studies cited are over 30 years old! Studies this old also tend to suffer from a host of methodological problems addressed [here](https://archive.ph/uY9Yr#h.45yxnhgfwyuf).

○ This Heritage report claims that gender-affirming healthcare leads to more suicides among trans youth.

○ **HORRIBLE METHODOLOGY.** This is broken down in the next few bullet points.

○ The author tries to measure how accessible gender-affirming healthcare is for trans youth, but instead of looking at laws or clinical policies, he decided to use Google Trends search terms as a proxy of information. He chose vague search terms like “transgender” and “gender dysphoria” which doesn’t really gauge **how accessible trans healthcare is**, however it does gauge **the public’s interest in trans people**. These are two very different things which are not simply interchangeable.

○ The author also tries to make conclusions about trans youth suicides, but he never actually uses data specific to trans people. Instead, he pulls general suicide data on Gen Z as a whole and decides that somehow this reflects the specific situation for trans youth. His report doesn’t include any data whatsoever that’s specific to trans youth, even though this is the group of people he’s making such sweeping conclusions about.

○ The author notices that as transgender-related search terms increased, so did the suicide rate among Gen Z. However, this doesn’t mean that the transgender debate or trans people is the big thing fueling Gen Z’s depression. Correlation doesn’t automatically mean causation. In fact, there’s a number of other factors influencing Gen Z’s higher levels of suicidality and those factors are well documented - chalking it all up to “more trans healthcare” is insane.

○ 2014 review of research regarding transgender parenting - 51 papers analyzed

○ More research is needed (of course) to get a fuller understanding of those situations, but some broad themes regarding discrimination, parent-child relations, etc have emerged

■ Discrimination/transphobia is still major issue, e.g. in child custody cases, adoptions, and so on

■ Coming out as trans can have a big impact on the parent’s relationship with other family members, with a variety of possible results. Sometimes relationships improve after coming out, sometimes they get worse.

○ Some transgender parents said they would benefit from services tailored to their specific needs, e.g. trans parent support groups.

○ Interesting read, but the research on this specific topic is young so there’s a lot that’s just not conclusive. Also worth noting more research has come out since 2014 which this paper doesn’t account for

**GENDER AND SEX**
# **Gendered Behavior**
**At a young age, children learn and copy perceived a lot of gendered behavior, which in many cases leads to the limiting of children’s expression. This doesn’t necessarily prove that *all* gendered norms have a firm basis in nurture, that’s something that this doc hasn’t adequately addressed yet.**

**Note: this section is really in need of a rehaul, it isn’t necessarily representative of the general science here and it’s also vague on how much of gendered norms are nurtured as opposed to natured.**

## Logical points to keep in mind:
● Definitions and word meanings can change with time, they aren’t necessarily rooted in one place. If society begins to recognize a distinction between two synonyms, this isn’t necessarily abnormal nor necessarily bad.

● Many people use “gender” and “sex” interchangeably in a casual context which is fine, but we are talking within the context of transgender people. Words can often have specialized definitions depending on the context: for example, the word "derivative" in a casual setting [has a very different meaning](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/derivative) compared to when it's used [in the context of calculus](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative). Science usually requires that we abandon colloquial definitions - they’re simply too vague and too arbitrary to be useful. Physicists have their own definition of ‘mass’ that differs from the colloquial concept. In the context of transgender people, "sex" and "gender" take on more specialized meanings which we wouldn’t see as much in a casual, everyday conversation.

● A sex/gender distinction is already used in definitions for “transgender”

○ [Merriam Webster](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/transgender) defines “transgender” as being “*of, relating to, or being a person **whose gender identity differs from the sex** the person had or was identified as having at birth*”

○ [Oxford English Dictionary](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/247649) defines transgender as “*Designating a person whose **sense of personal identity and gender does not correspond to that person's sex at birth**, or which does not otherwise conform to conventional notions of sex and gender.*”

● This gender/sex distinction is a semantic difference, so it **doesn't need to be proven with studies**. This is a distinction that exists because the relevant medical communities defined the words "gender" and "sex" differently to fit these specific niches in that medical context. Asking for a study to prove the distinction is like asking for a study which proves that happiness and sadness semantically are not the same thing - obviously “happiness” and “sadness” are referring to different concepts because we defined those words like that. What matters here is that we recognize the situation is really just two different words defining two different concepts.

○ “Two different concepts? What?” Let’s look at that bit [using the NIH's definitions](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://orwh.od.nih.gov/sex-gender):

■ *"Sex" refers to biological differences between females and males, including chromosomes, sex organs, and endogenous hormonal profiles.*

■ *"Gender" refers to socially constructed and enacted roles and behaviors which occur in a historical and cultural context and vary across societies and over time.*

○ Would you agree that these two words are defined differently, and that they are referring to different concepts? Sex is being defined in reference to biological stuff, while gender is defined in reference to more socially constructed stuff. We don't need a study to prove that these two words are referring to two different concepts.

● If the semantic distinction still doesn't sit right with you, you can always say "gender identity" and "biological sex" as it creates a clear distinction between the two without being as confusing.

**An analogy to help explain the distinction between gender and sex, with a focus on age** (complementing biological sex in that it’s more concrete and unchangeable) **and maturity** (complementing gender identity in that it’s socially constructed):

● James is 16 years old. You'd expect him to be whatever brash, obnoxious, wreckless person you'd expect a 16-year-old to be - but he covers his family's bills, he works a job to take care of his siblings, and he's basically acting as an adult even though he is 16 years old and is expected to be irresponsible and rowdy. He's grown out of being a child and effectively acts as an adult. You could point out that he’s 16 and that he is still legally a child, but the way he acts, how he presents, and who and where he hangs around effectively means his actions reflect that of a mature adult.

● Here, we’ve essentially substituted biological sex for age (instead of being male or female, the focus is now your age) and maturity for gender (this is the more socially constructed side of things). Even though we regularly associate different ages with different levels of maturity (similarly to how gender and sex are intertwined), we’re still able to recognize how these are distinct concepts which aren’t always tied together in the same way, i.e. childish adults and mature youth.

● Even though immaturity is associated with young people and maturity with adults, we see James breaking that norm by being both mature and a young person. Similarly, even though we expect men to act in a certain way and women a certain way, transgender people break that norm insofar as they pick up social roles not associated with their biological sex.

○ Interesting origins of gendered terms and raising children

○ *“Nor have boys always even been called boys. **Until the late 15th century the word ‘girl’ simply means a child of either sex**. Boys, where they had to be differentiated, were referred to as ‘knave girls’ and girls in the female sense were called ‘gay girls’. Equally a boy could be a ‘knave child’ and a girl a ‘maiden child’. The term ‘boy’ was reserved for servants or ‘churls’, the meaning ‘young man’ probably deriving from the latter as a pejorative term but not occurring before 1440.”*

○ Gendered behaviours and associated responsibilities have seen some changes even in recent times. For example:

■ Women have consistently become more involved in working for money and bringing income home (pg 11)

■ Women are now having a much greater presence in higher education, out-graduating males in college (pg 17)

■ Fathers are now more expected to take a role in childcare, though in most instances mothers do the majority of childcare work (pg 29)

○ **As late as the 1960s, “gender” was rarely used in the social sciences** nor in the scientific community in general, **back when we didn’t know as much about sex and gender as we do now**

○ **When it was introduced it was done specifically with a gender-sex distinction in mind**: “*Money (1996) later wrote that he imported the term gender into sexological science “to make it possible to write about people who came into one’s office as either male or female, but of whom it could not be said that their sex role in the specific genital sense was either male or female insofar as they had a history of birth defect of the sex organs.*”

■ Yes, Money did introduce the word - “*Excluding grammatical uses, most, if not all, of the gender-containing titles in SCI and SSCI from the 1960s appear to have derived the term from Money.*”

■ Keep in mind this is also the Money who’s [infamous for child abuse and a failed transitioning project](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer) (addressed [here](https://archive.ph/uY9Yr#h.r4o8idv0ll4)), that’s bad

● [Richardson et al 18](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797619872762?journalCode=pssa)

○ A **peer reviewed** paper published by the **same journal** cites conceptual and empirical problems with the “gender-equality paradox in STEM” hypothesis.

○ The researchers revealed that the Soet et al. 18 paper had omissions and inconsistencies in their research, namely inconsistent and undisclosed modification of the source data and a poorly conceived methodology. [This warranted a correction from Stoet et al by the publisher](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797619892892).

○ The authors conclude a “nonsignificant correlation between nation-level gender equality and women in STEM when measures of gender equality and STEM achievement were changed indicates that the association is sensitive to choice of measures of gender equality, range  of countries, and STEM achievement.”

■ National-level indicators of gender equality are a poor metric for discerning causal relationships between gender equality and percentages of women in STEM.

○ The paper explains the gender-math stereotype as a combination of various theories:

■ A way for dominant groups to differentiate themselves

■ According to evolutionary theory, social differentiation to achieve more cooperation between individuals by creating smaller subgroups with clear boundaries

■ Members of wealthier and more egalitarian countries tend to fall back to gender-essentialist norms for self-identification and self-expression

■ The importance of math between developed and developing countries

■ The strength of parent involvement in education creating more chances for spreading gender-stereotypes

# **Addressing Misconceptions about Gender and Sex**
● **“But sex is determined by chromosomes! XX for women and XY for men.”**

○ What about people with XXX, or XYY, or other combinations? [These people do exist](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.who.int/genomics/gender/en/index1.html). The XX/XY dichotomy doesn’t include these people, and thus does not reflect the real world fully and accurately. The XX/XY dichotomy is still useful for everyday use as it includes most people, but if we’re looking for accuracy over convenience, we can’t ignore those who have uncommon chromosome sets.

● **“Intersex people are too uncommon to be relevant, so they don’t count.”**

○ [The frequency of intersex people is unclear](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://isna.org/faq/frequency/) for a number of reasons (opening up for a wide range of estimates), but let’s settle for a broad definition: “people whose bodies differ from standard male or female”. The Intersex Society of North America (linked earlier) suggests that this applies to 1 in every 100 births. While that may seem like a small number at first, if we scale that up to all of humanity we end up with nearly 80 million people. [That’s larger than most countries are](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population) - certainly not an insignificant number.

○ Other estimates go even higher, [going up to 2% of births](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.intersexequality.com/how-common-is-intersex-in-humans/) - that’s about as common as red haired people are.

○ It’s important to emphasize that intersex is not just defined by one trait like ambiguous genitalia, but is rather defined by a broader grouping of abnormal sex characteristics. Some of the lower range estimates may have only considered one or two traits rather than expand their scope to account for the whole range of intersex people. As quoted from [here](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.intersexequality.com/how-common-is-intersex-in-humans/), “*Some groups use an old prevalence statistic that says we make up 1 in 2000, or .05%, percent of the population, but that statistic refers to one specific intersex trait, ambiguous genitalia, which is but one of many variations which, combined (as they are in medical diagnostics and coding), constitute the 1.7% estimate by esteemed Professor of Biology and Gender Studies, Anne Fausto-Sterling, of Brown University\*. A similar, slightly higher, statistic was also reported in, “How Sexually Dimorphic Are We?”, by Blackless, et al, in The American Journal of Human Biology.*”

○ Even if intersex people only make up a fraction of a % of all people, that still doesn’t mean that we can just ignore them - [Jews for example make up around 0.2% of the world population](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_religious_groups), but nobody says that Judaism isn’t a religion.

● **“Intersex people are all infertile, so they don’t count.”**

○ Infertility doesn’t automatically exclude you from being of a sex or etc - for example, [many women struggle with infertility](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://resolve.org/how-many-people-have-infertility/) (though it is a somewhat vague term) yet we don’t consider those women to not be women or to not be of any sex.

○ Regardless, not all intersex people are sterile, and in fact [plenty of intersex people end up going through forced sterilization](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/112848/9789241507325_eng.pdf) during their lifetimes, implying that they were not sterilized prior to going through the forced sterilization process.

● **“Can you name all the genders? If not, your take is invalid.”**

○ This question is a bit dishonest. It’s like taking a color wheel and asking for a number for how many colors there are.

○ 

○ Gender as a concept (socially constructed and something which varies based on the specific person) is comparable to emotions and personalities. Basically, **there's ways to express yourself which are basically qualitative, not quantitative - emotions and personalities, and of course, gender**. How many emotions exist? How many personalities? There is no true answer to how many personalities exist or how many emotions exist. These are qualitative ideas, just like gender.

■ Yes, people do try to categorize ideas like emotions and personalities, just as people categorize gender. [Here’s an emotion color wheel](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/614966433281212433/812129928484749352/emotion_wheel2_colour.png) which does just that.

■ This comparison is further strengthened by **the role they all play in personal identity**. Personalities, emotions, gender, etc all have a role in shaping who you are as a person and how you interact with the world around you.

○ If you’re confused about how the word “gender” is being used in this context, you might want to see [this section](https://archive.ph/uY9Yr#h.9a00yzaqmnp8) for clarification. “Gender” is being used to refer to the socially constructed and cultural side of the coin, while “sex” refers more strictly to the biological side of the coin.

● **“Gender and sex are basically the same thing because they have a correlative or causative relationship, or because they’re intertwined, etc.”**

○ Two things having a causative connection doesn't make them literally the same thing. You could say that education and income have a causative connection - people with higher education levels are more able to reach well paying jobs as they're more qualified for them - but that doesn't mean that education and income are the same thing.

○ The idea that "sex determines your gender" already assumes that assumes gender and sex are two distinct things, that this one distinct thing determines this other distinct thing - this completely undermines the idea that they’re the same.

● **“Men are men and women are women. That means a man can’t be a woman nor vice versa.”**

○ “Men are men and women are women” is tautological and therefore meaningless. It’s like saying “the sky is the sky and blue is blue”, it doesn’t really mean anything.

○ Upon clarification, they might clarify “what I’m trying to say is that it’s impossible to change the sex you’re born as”. The problem is that trans people are not changing their sex, they are changing their gender. This usually loops the conversation back to whether or not there’s a gender-sex distinction, which in turn is addressed [here](https://archive.ph/uY9Yr#h.9a00yzaqmnp8).

○ “*We conclude that **there is a [lack] of scientifically sound research on the safety of SOCE**. Early and recent research studies provide no clear indication of the prevalence of harmful outcomes among people who have undergone efforts to change their sexual orientation or the frequency of occurrence of harm because no study to date of adequate scientific rigor has been explicitly designed to do so... However, studies from both [early and recent] periods indicate that **attempts to change sexual orientation may cause or exacerbate distress and poor mental health in some individuals, including depression and suicidal thoughts**.*” (pg 42)

○ “*The recent nonreligious interventions are based on the assumption that homosexuality and bisexuality are mental disorders or deficits and are based on older discredited psychoanalytic theories.

# **Homosexual Parenting**
**Homosexual parents are just as good as heterosexual ones, according the the majority of research on the subject. However, most of the research is poor in quality or flawed in some other way, leaving a need for higher quality research.**

○ A **literature compilation** of **79** peer reviewed studies on gay and lesbian parents

○ **75** concluded that children of gay or lesbian parents fare no worse than other children.

○ The other four took their samples from children who endured family break-ups, a cohort known to face added risks. Scholars consider them unreliable, and [one even has a letter rebuking it signed by 150+ experts](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.impactprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Letter-to-the-editors-and-advisory-editors-of-Social-Science-Research.pdf).

○ Unfortunately, [nearly all of the studies use convenience sampling](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5204099/), which is considered to be **low-quality data**.

■ However, the Cornell meta-analysis suggests this isn’t a particularly big deal: *“researchers regard such studies as providing the best available knowledge about child adjustment, and do not view large, representative samples as essential”*

■ Since limits in data collection on this topic are almost inevitable, it’s important to approach such sources with caution.

○ Review of 30 years of research on homosexual parenting, finds that they fare just as well as heterosexual parents in **spite of social stigma against them**

○ Co-author of review acknowledges that in spite of most research on the subject coming to the same conclusion, **a lot of that research is low quality**- “[*none of the studies has been a randomized, controlled trial—the Holy Grail of scientific investigation—and all studies of gay parenting are necessarily small, since there aren’t many gay parents](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/www.bu.edu/articles/2013/gay-parents-as-good-as-straight-ones)*.*”

○ Publications based on NLLFS data find no substantial differences between same-sex and hetero-sexual parenting when it comes to children:

○ **Meta-analysis** of 81 studies on gay parenting, found overall inconclusive results

○ Of the several negative outcomes associated with gay parenting, a lot of varying data makes it hard to put together an overall reliable conclusion, and furthermore **it’s not even clear that these negative outcomes are due to gay parenting** - “*Whatever causes the differences observed in these samples between children raised by gay or lesbian parents and children raised by heterosexual parents, it is not parenting behavior.*”

○ **Found no substantial difference between gay parenting and lesbian parenting** - “*A third potential explanation, based on theories of gender development… has to do with the presence of a parent of the same or opposite gender as the child. There was, however, no support for this explanation. Children raised by gay fathers were no different than children raised by lesbian mothers, and the differences associated with parent sexual orientation did not vary between boys and girls.*”

○ **Homosexual parents tend to be more motivated to raise children** compared to heterosexual parents, as **homosexual parents rarely have unwanted children** compared to heterosexual parents

○ **Homosexual parents are also very useful when it comes to adoptions** - “*According to a 2007 report by the Williams Institute and the Urban Institute, 65,000 kids were living with adoptive gay parents between 2000 and 2002*”

■ A lot of those children are also racial minorities or special-ed, who normally spend more time in the adoption system

○ **An estimated 2 million gay people have expressed interest in adoptions** - that means a lot of kids who could potentially get out of the adoption system. Even if someone believes that gay parents fare worse that heterosexual parents, **it’s much harder to concede that gay parents would raise a child worse than an orphanage would**.

○ **MASSIVE survey** of 150+ questions and **12,005 respondents** who answered most of them

○ Easy to read, goes over the impact of parent support on LGBT youth

○ **LGBTQ youth family stats:**

■ **Only 24%** can “definitely” **be themselves** as an LGBTQ person at home

■ **67%** hear their families make **negative comments** about LGBTQ people. This number jumps to 78% if they haven’t come out as LGBTQ to their parents

■ **48%** out to their parents say that their **families make them feel bad** for being LGBTQ

○ **LGBTQ youth school stats:**

■ **Only 27%** can “definitely” be themselves **in school** as an LGBTQ person

● **Only 13%** report hearing positive messages about being LGBTQ in school

● And **only 12%** received information about safe sex that was relevant to them as an LGBTQ person

■ **Only 26% report that they always feel safe in the classroom**

● **73%** have experienced **verbal threats** because of their actual or perceived LGBTQ identity

● **70%** have been **bullied at school** because of their sexual orientation

● **51%** of Trans Youth can never use the restrooms or locker rooms that match their gender identity, either from school-sponsored restrictions (17%), the perception of a lack of safety (58%), or uncertainty towards school policy (46%). **65%** of students with this issue try to **avoid using the bathroom entirely at school** in response

○ Some methodology notes:

■ *“A post-hoc mischievous responder’s sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify and delete mischievous or intentionally misleading cases, resulting in 96 deleted cases.”*

■ *In total, 29,291 youth entered the survey website. Among these respondents, 17,112 completed at least 10 percent of the survey, 12,005 completed at least half, and 9,460 completed the entire survey. In this report, the 50 percent and up sample (n=12,005) was utilized for analyses.*

# **Homosexuality and Pedophilia**
**WIP**
## General overview:
Videos that cover a lot of the stuff in this section but in video format:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV5PbrTySxY](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV5PbrTySxY) short video which hones in on some key concepts

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26CIdhTnbV4](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26CIdhTnbV4) longer video which covers a bunch of studies

[https://lgbpsychology.org/html/facts_molestation.html](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://lgbpsychology.org/html/facts_molestation.html) thorough webpage which covers the stuff in this section and more, including the typologies and various studies. also written by a highly influential and respected scholar in the field

It’s important to note that most studies on this topic are several decades old, usually from the 70s and 80s. Studies conducted back then didn’t have the same resources or level of knowledge that we do today, and also [society’s opinions on gay people have changed a lot](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://news.gallup.com/poll/258065/gallup-first-polled-gay-issues-changed.aspx) since that time period. These studies may be tainted with decades-old cultural bias as a result of what most people believed at the time.
## Typologies of child sex offenders:
Before talking about homosexuality in relation to pedophilia, we have to understand how exactly pedophilia and CSA breaks down. [Groth & Birnbaum 1978](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01542377) is an old but important study which put together a framework for this. It broke down a sample of 175 child sex offenders into two groups: “fixated” and “regressive”, though today they’re referred to as “preferential” and “situational” respectively.

● **Fixated/Preferential** offenders are simply attracted to kids. They are pedophiles and have a documentable history of being attracted to children. Usually what matters to the fixated offender is not what sex the kid is, but the fact that the kid is young to begin with (pre-pubescent children haven’t gone through puberty so aren’t nearly as distinct in masculine/feminine body types as someone who has gone through puberty).

● **Regressive/Situational** offenders are adults who are otherwise sexually normal but “regressed” to being attracted to children for a short amount of time due to external stressors. These people don’t have a history of being attracted to children. The study gives the example of Ted, who is a straight man with a sexual history of dating/marrying adult women, only for him to go through a regressive phase immediately after his marriage falls apart, during which he sexually assaulted a 10-year-old boy.

This typology was made in the 70s, but was [further studied and expanded on in following decades](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.bishop-accountability.org/reports/2004_02_27_JohnJay/LitReview/1_4_JJ_TypologiesOf.pdf) (more info on that [here](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.icmec.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/US-NCMEC-OJJDP-Child-Molesters-A-Behavioral-Analysis-Lanning-2010.pdf%23page=48)). There are other typologies but the preferential/situational typology is still broadly accepted in the academic community, just with some nuance talked about in the above links.

So where do gay people come into play? The [original 1978 study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01542377) talked about this at length and went as far as to argue that **homosexual pedophiles are a phenomenon entirely separate from normal gay men**. This passage from the study explains:

“*There were no peer-oriented homosexual males in our sample who regressed to children. Homosexuality and homosexual pedophilia are not synonymous. In fact, it may be that these two orientations are mutually exclusive, the reason being that the homosexual male is sexually attracted to masculine qualities whereas the heterosexual male is sexually attracted to feminine characteristics, and the sexually immature child’s qualities are more feminine than masculine.*”

Essentially, **normal gay people are entirely different from pedophiles because the qualities that gay men find attractive in other men are completely different from the qualities that pedophiles (straight or otherwise) find attractive in children**. This also means that a male pedophile who molests a boy is not automatically gay - this is very important to remember when looking at studies on this subject, and something that a lot of people forget.
## Useful studies:
● [Stevenson 2001](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J056v12n04_01)

○ Very useful study about the various flaws in anti-gay arguments and related studies. Also provides a systematic review of 20+ years of research

○ Points out that in the past, **various stigmatized groups have been accused of molesting children, often without evidence**: “*Research on prejudice shows that members of stigmatized groups (e.g., Catholics, Jews, developmentally disabled people, AfricanAmericans) tend to be accused of the same sexual misconduct (e.g., rape, child abuse, and the inability to control their sexual impulses) (Martin, 1982; 1988; Schneider, 1993). The same unsupported rhetoric is reflected in the erroneous assumptions that adult men who sexually abuse boys are gay and that gay men molest children.*”

○ This paper goes great lengths to point out, in very blunt terms, that **engaging in same-sex behavior does not automaticaly make someone gay**: “*Contrary to the assumptions made by the public (Ohi, 2000) and by anti-gay researchers and activists (e.g., Cameron & Cameron, 1996; 1998), **engaging in same-sex behavior is not synonymous with the adoption of a gay identity** (i.e., being gay or lesbian) regardless of the ages of the participants ... **over 9 percent of men had engaged in a same-sex sexual behavior at least once since puberty, whereas only 2.8 percent reported some level of gay identity** ... To put this in the context of the sexual coercion of children, **when sexual behavior occurs between an adult and a child of the same sex, we cannot infer the sexual orientation of either party.***”

○ **Even in the 90s, there were a LOT of studies that concluded gay men are no more likely than straight men to be child molesters**: “*In spite of Western culture’s failure to distinguish consistently between gay men, ‘‘child molesters,’’ and pedophiles (Ohi, 2000), **numerous empirical studies support the conclusion that a gay man is no more likely than a straight man to perpetrate sexual activity with children** (Barret & Robinson, 1994; Becker et al., 1995; Groth & Birnbaum, 1978; Groth, 1978; Herek, 1991; Jenny, Roesler & Poyer, 1994; Patterson, 1997; Sarafino, 1979).*”

○ In general this paper has a lot of detailed, thoughtful discussion about various studies, including critiques of anti-gay activism and the studies they cite. Very useful paper if you have the time to delve into it

● [McConaghy 1998](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.3109/00048679809062736)

○ Broader literature review on pedophilia but includes a section on homosexuality

○ **Most pedophiles are more attracted to someone’s youth than they are to either particular sex**: “*The man who offends against prepubertal or immediately postpubertal boys is typically not sexually interested in older men or in women.*”

○ **People associate gays with pedophiles not because of actual evidence but because of intense media focus on the topic**: “*The confusion of homosexuality and paedophilia would appear to result from the much greater media and legal attention given to homosexual as compared to heterosexual paedophilia. This appears uninfluenced by the findings that there are many more heterosexual than homosexual paedophiles*”

● [Jenny et al. 1994](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/94/1/41/59154/Are-Children-at-Risk-for-Sexual-Abuse-by)

○ Study analyzed 352 children suspected of being victims of child sex abuse. That group was narrowed down to 269 children who were molested by pedophiles.

○ “*Using the data from our study, the 95% confidence limits, of **the risk children would identify recognizably homosexual adults as the potential abuser, are from 0% to 3.1%**. These limits are **within current estimates of the prevalence of homosexuality in the general community**.*”

## Flawed/unreliable studies:
● [Freund & Watson 1992](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1556756/)

○ Study that’s **regularly cited by anti-gay activists to claim that gay men are more likely to be pedophiles** than straight men are

○ Study that uses phallometric testing to measure the “true” sexual preference of 465 child molesters, 90+% of whom were understood to be pedophiles. By doing this they found a 11:1 straight:gay ratio among pedophiles, so around 92% of pedophiles are straight and 8% are gay

○ While the methodology isn’t necessarily bad, **the results need to be reinterpreted**. Activists will often say it means 8% of pedophiles are gay, which is a disproportionate amount relative to the gay population (4% of the US population), but it’s only *slightly* disproportionate, an amount so small you could chalk it up to statistical error. For reference, straight people were reportedly 96% of the US population and were predicted by the study to be 92% of all pedophiles, a measly difference which could be due to statistical error. The difference just seems bigger for gay people (4% vs 8%) because the gay population is simply way smaller than the straight population, even though the statistical error is the exact same size. Ergo, **neither straight people nor gay people are disproportionately represented among pedophiles**.

# **Rebutting myths about LGB people**
**CLAIM: Gay people molest kids far more frequently than straight people.**

● This claim was popularized in part by disgraced psychologist [Paul Cameron](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Cameron), who is [well known to have misrepresented data before](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_cameron.html) to promote an anti-gay agenda. The Family Research Council, an anti-gay religious group, has also pushed this claim.

● While it’s still unknown what causes homosexuality, chances are it’s not due to one environmental variable (e.g. child sexual abuse), but rather a variety of genetic and environmental variables: [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/06/080628205430.htm](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/06/080628205430.htm)

## Specific Studies:
● [Regnerus 12](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0049089X12000610), sometimes called the New Family Structures Study ([wikipedia](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Family_Structures_Study))

○ **Claims that same-sex couples have a negative impact on their children** as opposed to heterosexual couples

○ **METHODOLOGICAL FLAWS - ignores factors like family instability**

■ This problem goes as deep as the questionnaire that defined the samples - the questions basically barred unstable, broken straight homes out of the sample whereas unstable gay families were included in the data. [This Slate article explains it well](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://slate.com/technology/2012/06/new-family-structures-study-is-gay-parenthood-bad-or-is-gay-marriage-good.html):

● “_The survey went on to ask: “From when you were born until age 18 … did either of your parents ever have a romantic relationship with someone of the same sex?” If the respondent said yes, he was put in the “gay father” (GF) or “lesbian mother” (LM) category, regardless of subsequent answers. But if he said no, a later question about the relationship between “your biological parents” was used to classify him as the product of an “intact biological family” (IBF) or of an “adopted,” “divorced,” “stepfamily,” or “single-parent” household. **In other words, broken families were excluded from the IBF**_ **[straight couple] _category but included in the GF and LM_ [gay couple] _categories_**_._”

■ Subsequent studies, which were done **WITH REGNERUS’S DATA**, found that **different results were found upon accounting for factors like family instability** ([first](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0049089X1500085X)) ([second](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.sociologicalscience.com/articles-v2-23-478/)). It’s worth noting that the first paper has since gotten a response from Regnerus.

○ [Outside of the study design, ](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0049089X12001652)[**certain problems have also been raised about the study's timeline, peer review**](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0049089X12001652)[, etc](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0049089X12001652)

○ [**Raised concern and criticism from 200+ scientists**](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.impactprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Letter-to-the-editors-and-advisory-editors-of-Social-Science-Research.pdf)[, a great deal of whom have PhDs in relevant fields](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.impactprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Letter-to-the-editors-and-advisory-editors-of-Social-Science-Research.pdf). These were not merely concerns about being politically correct, but were actual criticisms of the study methodology, results, and the specifics of the study’s approval process.

○ Even if the study is robust, policy implications aren’t necessarily straightforward. Regnerus himself [has said](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://familyinequality.wordpress.com/2013/03/01/marriage-denial/) that “*The political take-home message of the NFSS study is unclear, however. On the one hand, the instability detected in the NFSS **could translate into a call for extending the relative security afforded by marriage to gay and lesbian couples**.*” In other words, you could interpret his study as an argument in favor of gay marriage, as legalizing gay marriage would offer gay couples the extra benefits and stabilizing impact that straight couples are already given.

○ **Used by gay-straight conversion therapy advocates to suggest that conversion therapy works**

○ **SAMPLE BIAS** - 93% sought therapy due to religious beliefs and 78% had publicly supported conversion therapy, thus motivating them to overreport success.

■ In fact, [**two thirds of the participants had been referred from groups which are pro conversion therapy**](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/straight-if-they-want/), further undermining the usefulness of the sample: “*Some 43 percent of the sample had been referred to Spitzer by "ex-gay ministries" that offer programs to gay people who seek to change* [...] *An additional 23 percent were referred by the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality, which says most of its members consider homosexuality a developmental disorder.*”

■ Even if all of the reports are legitimate and there 100% was conversion therapy, it’s still worth considering that **these results still might only apply to people who are highly motivated** to change sexual orientation, and wouldn’t work on the typical gay person. Spitzer himself [has said multiple times](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://respectmyresearch.org/scientists/dr-robert-spitzer/) following the study that he expected conversion therapy to only work on a small number of homosexuals. This makes sense too once you consider the sample bias of the study.

○ Bisexuality is completely ignored by Spitzer, meaning that any bisexuals in the study probably would have been considered homosexual from the start

○ **The study was formally disavowed by Spitzer** in 2012 due to its flaws, and [he’s criticized anti-gay groups for abusing his research for their agenda](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://respectmyresearch.org/scientists/dr-robert-spitzer/).

■ Some people say that he disavowed the study due to pressure from LGBT groups, but this view both pivots from the various flaws of the study and ignores that he reached that view from over a decade of retrospection, whereas most of the political pressure likely came from the study’s first step into the spotlight in 2001.

○ Some more info about its flaws [here](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_changing.html) and [here](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287322196_Understanding_the_self-reports_of_reparative_therapy_successes) - probably worth citing if the study comes up in a discussion

○ **Used by gay-straight conversion therapy advocates to suggest that conversion therapy works**

○ **CAN’T BE EXTRACTED TO GENERAL POPULACE** - “*The sampling procedures did not permit the researchers to keep a count of the number of people who were invited to participate in the survey, and so it is not possible to estimate response rates. Thus, it is important to keep in mind that **the results of this survey cannot be meaningfully generalized beyond the present sample. The survey also does not allow us to draw conclusions about what percentage of dissatisfied homosexually oriented people who experience conversion therapy find it helpful or unhelpful**. All we can confidently conclude is that the survey enabled us to find out more about the beliefs and attitudes of this specific sample of dissatisfied homosexually oriented people.*”

■ Keep in mind that **this does not render the data of this study as useless**, as it could be used to figure out general attitudes regarding what CT practices worked or failed for those particular clients, and those practices could be experimented more on in the future

○ Sample bias likely plays a role as well - **96% of respondents said religion or spirituality matter a lot to them**, making them more likely to overreport success as Abrahamic religions are generally pro-CT

○ Study used to claim that weak/unstable father relations cause homosexuality

○ The crux of the point relies on a 4.27 point difference between gays and straights on “Intimacy with Father”, the difference between a score of 39.27 and 35. See the table below:

○ In general, **the average scores that gays and straights got are very similar across the board**, none of them being more than 5 points apart. The standard deviations (labeled “SD”) are all remarkably similar too.

○ People will hone in on how gay people scored lower on “Intimacy with Father” compared to straights, but **the difference is scores is a pretty small 4.27 difference**. Given the small sample size (only 24 gay people surveyed!) even one outlier could make the difference here.

○ **EVEN IF gay people scored SIGNIFICANTLY lower on father intimacy, this doesn’t mean anything about father absence CAUSING gayness**. Correlation doesn’t automatically mean causation. On the flip side, you could argue the causation goes the other way around - gay people are often rejected from their families for being gay (a homosexuality → father absence effect).

**UNDERSTANDING CAPITALISM**
# **What is Capitalism?**
**A socioeconomic system where social relations are primarily based on commodities for exchange, specifically through private ownership of the means of production and distribution of said commodities and its use for the competitive maximization of capital (i.e. any form of profit) ultimately through the exploitation of wage labor.**

The underlying assumption that this definition has, that is, that capitalism is fundamentally based on the exploitation of wage labor, comes from the premise that the labor theory of value is true, in particular, Karl Marx’s. There are, however, competing theories of value in economics. One being the more classical labor theory of value, and the other being the neoclassical mainstream marginal utility theory of value. The “[capital debates](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_capital_controversy)” or the “[Cambridge capital controversy](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/heteconomist.com/three-economic-ideas-threatening-to-defenders-of-the-status-quo/)” is a memory-holed event in economic history where debates between both camps settled how marginalist views were divorced from economic reality in trying to deny that surplus labor is the basis of all profit in contrast to the Marxian/Post-Keynesian perspective.
# **What is the Labor Theory of Value? (Classical and Marxian Theory)**
“As the *exchangeable values* of commodities are only *social functions* of those things, and have nothing at all to do with the *natural* qualities, we must first ask: What is the common *social substance* of all commodities? It is *labour*. To produce a commodity a certain amount of labour must be bestowed upon it, or worked up in it. And I say not only *labour*, but *social labour*. A man who produces an article for his own immediate use, to consume it himself, creates a *product*, but not a *commodity*. As a self-sustaining producer he has nothing to do with society. But to produce a *commodity*, a man must not only produce an article satisfying some *social* want, but his labour itself must form part and parcel of the total sum of labour expended by society. It must be subordinate to the *division of labour within society*. It is nothing without the other divisions of labour, and on its part is required to *integrate* them.”-*Value, Price, and Profit by Karl Marx* Chapter VI

“The real price of everything, what everything really costs to the man who wants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble of acquiring it. What every thing is really worth to the man who has acquired it, and who wants to dispose of it or exchange it for something else, is the toil and trouble which it can save to himself, and which it (the commodity) can impose upon other people.” - *Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith* Book 1, chapter V

“The value of any commodity, [...] to the person who possesses it, and who means not to use or consume it himself, but to exchange it for other commodities, is equal to the quantity of labour which it enables him to purchase or command. Labour, therefore, is the real measure of the exchangeable value of all commodities”

-*Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith* Book 1, chapter V

"Trade in general being nothing else but the Exchange of Labour for Labour, the Value of All Things is... most justly measured by Labour." *-The Nature and Necessity of a Paper-Currency by Benjamin Franklin*

"As Silver itself is of no certain permanent Value, being worth more or less according to its Scarcity or Plenty, therefore it seems requisite to fix upon Something else, more proper to be made a *Measure of Values*, and this I take to be Labour"- *-The Nature and Necessity of a Paper-Currency by Benjamin Franklin*

A labor theory of value is a theory of economic value used to determine what would be the common unit of measurement to explain what common/social intrinsic value would be the base of economic exchange. Labor theories of value were thought out by various historical thinkers independently throughout many centuries such as Thomas Aquinas in his [Summa Theologiae](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/summa-theologiae.org/), Ibn Khaldun in his [Muqaddimah](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://sheikhynotes.blogspot.com/2010/08/ibn-khaldun_22.html), Sir William Petty in his [Treatise of Taxes of 1662](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/www.hargaden.com/enda/wp-content/petty_taxescontributions.pdf), John Locke’s [labor theory of property](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_property), and in Benjamin Franklin’s “[The Nature and Necessity of a Paper-Currency](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-01-02-0041%23BNFN-01-01-02-0041-fn-0012)”, that which Karl Marx [credits for his inspiration for his value theory](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://journals.psu.edu/pmhb/article/download/42165/41886). Most notably however, it is used by classical economists such as Adam Smith in his Wealth of Nations, David Ricardo in his Principles of Political Economy and Taxation, and of course in Karl Marx’s various works such as in Capital. Marx, however, is the only one to both follow the labor theory of value and formulate one to its logical conclusion, that in order for capitalists to make a profit, they would have to exploit wage-labor for it being the sole source of intrinsic value within any commodity.

The labour theory of value according to Karl Marx’s “[law of value](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1865/value-price-profit/ch02.htm%23c6)” holds that the common unit of measurement to determine the intrinsic value within commodities for their exchange, is determined by the socially necessary labor time required to produce it. **Socially necessary labor time is the average amount of labor time needed to produce or obtain something which is socially demanded for in the market, making it “necessary”.**
# **What is the Marginal Utility (“Subjective”) Theory of Value? (Mainstream/Neoclassical Theory)**

# **On LTV Empirical Evidence**
**There is very strong empirical evidence confirming the validity of the labor theory of value  over that of the mainstream marginal utility theory of value.**

○ Finds a large body of evidence that suggests that **wealth inequality is worse for economic mobility**, and that **increased wealth inequality can diminish the impact of hard work** relative to the reward for such work

○ *“**Inequality lowers mobility because it shapes opportunity.** It heightens the income consequences of innate differences between individuals; it also changes opportunities, incentives, and institutions that form, develop, and transmit characteristics and skills valued in the labor market; and it shifts the balance of power so that some groups are in a position to structure policies or otherwise support their children’s achievement independent of talent.”*

○ This study looked at income inequality by examining the 100 lowest and 100 highest per capita income counties in the United States from 1969 to 2017. It found that "Both groups of counties changed slowly from decade to decade and over the nearly fifty years examined." Because the inequality was so slow to change, the researchers conclude:

○ "Fifty years from now, the people of the lowest income counties are still likely to be members of racial and ethnic minority groups. And, fifty years from now the people of the lowest income counties are likely to remain less well-educated than the people of the highest income counties or the nation."

○ "Dramatic technological and institutional changes over the last fifty years have not altered the nature of regional income inequality in a substantial way, nor are such changes likely to do so during the next fifty years."

○ “*Rising income inequality since the 1980s in the United States has generated a substantial increase in saving by the top of the income distribution, which we call the saving glut of the rich. **The saving glut of the rich has been as large as the global saving glut, and it has not been associated with an increase in investment. Instead, the saving glut of the rich has been linked to the substantial dissaving and large accumulation of debt by the non-rich**. Analysis using variation across states shows that the rise in top income shares can explain almost all of the accumulation of household debt held as a financial asset by the household sector. Since the Great Recession, the saving glut of the rich has been financing government deficits to a greater degree.*”

○ A bit hard to give clear, 100% solid results as **there’s a lot of variability in results** - “*Both the quantity and variation in estimates pose a challenge not only for researchers but also for policy makers. Summarizing the findings is not straightforward.*”

○ Finds that “Increasing the federal minimum wage would have two principal effects on low-wage workers. For most low-wage workers,earnings and family income would increase, which would lift some families out of poverty, But other low-wage workers would become jobless, and their family income would fall—in some cases, below the poverty threshold.”

○ Also “A higher minimum wage can affect family income in a variety of ways. Most directly, a higher minimum wage boosts income for the families of most low-wage workers, though a small share of low-wage workers may see their family income fall if they are jobless for an extended period.”

○ Raising minimum wage to $15 would see an estimated 1.3 million people without jobs, but wages would rise for an estimated 17 million.

○ Almost 50 percent of the jobless every week (about 600,000) would be teenagers, some of whom would live with families with incomes way over the poverty threshold.

**CLAIM: Increasing the minimum wage would cause unemployment**

● This would be plausible if the market was perfectly competitive. However, the market is monopsonistic and firms can use their monopsony power to reduce the wages they pay workers to below the level in a competitive environment which kills jobs. For example, [labor markets are highly concentrated](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=442100001087088100014104091102103126033069042014023087069030092022115001096003124121107056043003059006011084118125009000064010098001090058041016065125096106088080008035052084073092115092007029118122094027126084067003085082116109117067101079079116104&EXT=pdf&INDEX=TRUE): the average is Herfindahl–Hirschman Index 3,157, which is above the 2,500 threshold for high concentration according to the Department of Justice / Federal Trade Commission horizontal merger guidelines. Going from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile in concentration is associated with a 17% decline in posted wages, suggesting that concentration increases labor market power and monopsony power. This is corroborated by [labor markets in U.S. manufacturing being far from perfectly competitive: the average plant operates in a monopsonistic environment, as it charges a markdown of 1.53.](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2020/preliminary/paper/nTEa9QhN) This indicates wages below the marginal product of labor further suggesting monopsony power. So a minimum wage doesn’t actually cause unemployment in fact funnel graphs show that the effects of minimum wage on employment cluster around zero and studies are now showing it has a minuscule effect on employment since David Card and Alan Krueger came out with a [landmark study in 1994](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/njmin-aer.pdf) showing that a big minimum wage hike didn’t cause unemployment.

**But employers will need more experienced and harder workers!**

● Minimum wages might instead improve the relative employment prospects of disadvantaged workers For example, barriers to mobility are greater among minorities than among teens as a whole. Higher pay then increases the returns to worker search and overcomes existing barriers to employment that are not based on skill and experience differentials. A higher minimum wage could help disadvantaged workers to cover the costs of finding and keeping a job, including, for example, transportation, child-care, and uniforms. This is corroborated by the [employment effect of the minimum wage on white, black, and Hispanic teens as there is no statistically significant effect of the minimum wage on teens as a whole, or on any of the three racial and ethnic groups, separately, after controlling for region of the country](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://irle.berkeley.edu/files/2011/Do-Minimum-Wages-Really-Reduce-Teen-Employment.pdf). There’s also no evidence that employers change the age or gender composition in the restaurant sector in response to the minimum wage as [Dube, Lester, and Reich (2012)](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://irle.berkeley.edu/files/2012/Minimum-Wage-Shocks-Employment-Flows-and-Labor.pdf) demonstrates. Teens from [more affluent areas increased their labor supply (and employment) after the 1996-1997 increases in the minimum wage, while employment of teens in less affluent areas experienced no statistically significant change in employment](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254429129_Minimum_Wage_Effects_on_Employment_Substitution_and_the_Teenage_Labor_Supply_Evidence_from_Personnel_Data).

**CLAIM: Increasing the minimum wage would accelerate automation**

First of all, automation has already occurred rapidly where technological possibilities permit. Additional automation may occur in manufacturing, but the minimum wage effects will be small because labor costs increases are far outweighed by reductions in technology costs. Employer survey and behavior shows that firms would prefer to raise prices over reducing capacity, by reducing staff and operating hours.

Second of all, this is doubly wrong. On the one hand, there's little guarantee that increased minimum wages really will increase the pace at which labor-saving technology is developed. On the other hand, there's no reason to think this would be a bad scenario.If minimum wage hikes really do spur the creation and adoption of high-quality new equipment to automate elements of, say, the food service industry, then that would be a very positive outcome that implies minimum wage hikes are a great idea.

● Most restaurants would keep longer hours (they're paying for the rent and the robots anyway), meaning many workers would get a raise and change shifts.

● The advanced robo-restaurant technology would itself be a valuable American export good, and people would be employed in designing and selling it.

● Some low-wage work would be reallocated out of the relatively low-social-value restaurant sector and into things like child care and home health assistance, for which there is ample demand.

● Since poor people are now making more money, there will be opportunities to sell them things — things like restaurant meals! — that they couldn't previously afford, which in turn creates demand for new jobs.

Even better, to the extent that we are able to produce everything we need with less labor, we can afford to let people work less. Right now the retirement age is rising from 65 to 67, and most people think it will have to go up to 70. If robots can do a lot of the work instead, we could put it back down to 65 or even to 62 while still growing the economy. We could give more financial support to college students so fewer of them are doing part-time food service work. We could give new parents more paid leave time and mandate four weeks of paid vacation for everyone.

**CLAIM: Raising the minimum wage would hurt small employers**

First of all, the locations for low wages tend to be smaller areas therefore there are fewer employers therefore more monopsony power. The opposite is actually true. Small employers may benefit from a higher minimum wage because of positive effects on worker retention and productivity and savings on recruitment and training costs. In fact, [the number of small businesses across the economy grew by 5.4% from 1998 to 2003 in the higher minimum wage states, compared to a 4.2% increase for the balance of the states](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://fiscalpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/FPISmallBusinessMinWage.pdf).

**CLAIM: The cost of living varies among location**

Congress discussed including a Southern differential in the debates leading up to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. In 1938, wage and living cost differences between the South and the non-South were much greater than they are today. But in the end, Congress decided to establish a single national minimum wage floor. By establishing a single national floor at a time of other major economic transformations, Congress set in motion a series of substantial positive economic changes in the South. In particular, the isolated economies of the rural South became more linked to the national economy. The South prospered in succeeding decades, and the southern regional wage differential became much smaller. A similar development occurred as a result of the civil rights revolution and the associated extension of Fair Labor Standard Act coverage to more of the South’s industries. So, Congress did authorize states to set higher floors. States began to do so in the 1980s and with increasing frequency, especially as Congressional inaction has allowed the real value of the minimum wage to decline over time. The patchwork of state minimum wages today allows states to adjust their minimum wages to reflect living cost differences among the states.

**CLAIM: The minimum wage won’t lead to increased productivity**

First of all, the minimum wage hasn’t even kept of with productivity. [Workers today who are paid the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour are, after adjusting for inflation, paid 29% less than their counterparts 50 years ago. This is despite the fact that the economy’s capacity to deliver higher wages has doubled in the last 50 years, as measured by labor productivity, or the amount of output produced by workers. Had the minimum wage kept pace with labor productivity growth since 1968, this year it would be more than $20 per hour](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.epi.org/publication/minimum-wage-testimony-feb-2019/).

Actually a higher minimum wage may increase productivity from a managerial standpoint and an employee standpoint. For example, fast food managers ([at about 90%](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://docs.iza.org/dp6132.pdf)) indicate that they plan to respond to the minimum-wage increase with increased performance standards such as "requiring a better attendance and on-time record, faster and more proficient performance of job duties, taking on additional tasks, and faster termination of poor performers." Roughly the same share of managers said that they sought to "boost morale" by presenting the minimum-wage increase as a "challenge to the store" and using this as a way "to energize employees to improve productivity"

Additionally, from a minimum wage increase may improve productivity independently of any actions by employers to increase productivity. According to "efficiency wage" theory, wages above the competitive-market rate may elicit greater work effort for several reasons. One is that efficiency wages could reduce shirking. Higher pay increases the cost to workers of losing their job, potentially inducing greater effort from workers in order to reduce their chances of being fired. From a more sociological point of view, workers may see higher wages as a gift from employers, leading workers to reciprocate by working harder. According to [James Rebitzer and Lowell Taylor (1995)](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w3877/w3877.pdf)’s model, a minimum wage in the context of efficiency wages "may increase the level of employment in low wage jobs." This is corroborated by the fact that [a 6% increase in the minimum wage, worker productivity (i.e. output per hour) in the bottom 40th percentile of the worker fixed effects distribution increases by about 4.6% relative to that in the higher percentiles](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://docs.iza.org/dp13369.pdf).

**CLAIM: If the minimum wage goes up then everything you have to pay for goes up**

This is only true for a perfectly competitive economy. Both because of the relatively small share of production costs accounted for by minimum wage labor and because of the limited spillovers from a minimum wage increase to wages of other workers, the effect of a minimum wage increase on the overall price level is likely to be small, which it is: [a 10% US minimum wage increase raises overall prices by no more than 0.4%](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-6419.2007.00532.x).

# **UBI and Redistributive Cash Transfers**
**Yeah it’s socdem but there’s utility in defending it, especially considering how advocating for UBI could move rightists further left (see how Yang temporarily brought over some republicans, for example). Regardless, UBI and RCT do seem to be effective at reducing poverty without causing many other problems, making it a viable policy in a capitalist system.**

This source lists three pro-RCT points, said points being:

\1. RCTs have positive effects on children, primarily increased weight for age and weight for height, 15% decreased rates of low birth-weight, and increased school attendance.

\2. Recipients of RCT use the income well, causing it to create long term benefit. Men’s income increased by 64-96% five years after receiving a transfer.

\3. Those receiving transfers don’t expend their income on unneeded commodities such as alcohol. There is also no significant impact on work-hours.

Test:

○ A test of a RCT was conducted in the Philippines, in which families would be given **conditional** grants of flat, untaxed payment depending on their financial and familial situation. The program primarily aimed to test RCT’s ability to break generational poverty and benefit children's future. Parents with children ranging age 0-14 are eligible for the health grants, receiving a total of ₱500 monthly, as long as conditions as to how well families follow health guidelines are met. For the education grants, the only conditions to apply for the benefit of ₱300 per child monthly are to have a child 6-14 in a low-income area, and to make sure the child attends at least 85% of school days.

Education results:

○ Attendance in preschool or daycare was 10.3% higher than the baseline of 65% for the low-income families without the RCT. Similarly, in children aged 6-11, enrolment in elementary school rose 4.5% higher than the baseline 93% in other low income households. However, for children 15-17, RCT had a **slight negative** effect on enrolment, but the RCT **did not** apply to the age group, so a positive effect on education **was not expected for those 15-17.** Similarly to the benefits in enrolment in most age groups, attendance in school **increased** in all age groups.

Health results:

○ Access to prenatal and postnatal care greatly increased for women affected by the RCT health benefits. (Prenatal by 10.5% and postnatal by 10%). It was also found that pregnant recipients of RCT made visits to prenatal facilities 1.6x more than the control. RCT also reduced severe stunting in affected children 6-36 months old by 10.1% from the 24% baseline. Alcohol consumption **reduced** by 39% in households affected by RCT.

Economic results:

○ Poor households receiving RCT increased spending on health services by 34%, increased spending on education by 38%, and increased spending on protein-rich foods by 38%. There was a reduction in poverty three years after the program’s initiation by 2.7%. This impact is small, but would likely increase as more time under the program passes for affected families. It was found there was **no significant change** in motivation to work.

● [Do The Poor Waste Transfers On Booze And Cigarettes? No.](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/do-poor-waste-transfers-booze-and-cigarettes-no)

This article makes the claim that recipients of RCT and UBI **do not** use their given income on goods such as alcohol. Examples are as follows:

\1. When examining 44 estimates of alcohol consumption across 19 studies and 13 interventions, the majority of studies report results of reduced alcohol consumption (82%).  

\2. There is little to no incentive for recipients to lie. The surveyors intentionally do not add items such as alcohol in separate lists, and treat them with the same significance as other household items. It’s also been shown that those with a non-zero baseline for alcohol don’t suddenly report spending nothing on alcohol, instead, they still tend to report a decreased, but not non-zero spending on alcohol. This trend implies that recipients do not try to “game the system,” and rather remain honest about their expenditures.

○ 1. Reduction of spousal abuse by the abused being given safe means to economically split with their abuser.

○ 2. Placing everyone above the poverty line, lowering crime as seen in the section [Poverty and Crime](https://archive.ph/uY9Yr#h.x0d9wwbw549z).

○ 4. Removing the need for social security, such as unemployment benefits and food stamps.

This article makes another libertarian defense of Universal Basic Income, some points being:

○ Under current social security measures, it is incentivised to remain in low income jobs due to threat of a loss of social security benefits. Even if these poorly paid workers were to expend effort towards a higher paying job, an increase in their income taxes would outweigh the benefits that going from a low-paying job with benefits to a high-paying one without could have. A universal income would remove these issues by providing a benefit that **is not** withdrawn as one’s income rises.

○ A UBI would allow for greater economic freedom for the recipient than the current social security measures, rather than forcing the worker’s hand into purchasing commodities they don’t want or need.

○ The increase in taxes to implement a UBI would not be substantial enough to outweigh the economic benefit it would have if it were implemented.

● [The Libertarian Case For a UBI](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://medium.com/swlh/the-libertarian-case-for-a-ubi-3469faaf6364)

This article makes a libertarian capitalist defense of Universal Basic Income, some points made are as follows:

○ Rather than decreasing work incentive, it would increase incentive as it would remove social security measures such as unemployment benefits that are dependent on remaining unemployed, whereas with UBI, one would receive the universal income atop the income they already receive from their job.

○ The U.S. government already spends **as much on poverty programs as it would cost to raise all under the poverty line over it.** Replacing those programs with one such as UBI would simplify the process while also being more effective at reducing poverty.

○ Instead of forcing those who benefit from the existing social security programs to spend the money allocated towards them on specific products, a predetermined UBI would allow them to make the choice on how to allocate their funds.

● [Universal Basic Income Explained](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl39KHS07Xc)

This video primarily lists the pros and cons of a “mincome system,” in which the UBI covers exclusively up to the point of the poverty line without any conditions. Topics discussed are as shown:

○ The impoverished **do not** spend their money received by UBI on harmful commodities such as alcohol or tobacco, and rather use the money to purchase other commodities.

○ Only ~1% of the recipients of UBI stop working. Those that do often use their time for goals such as schooling or better parenting their children.

○ Most welfare programs come with conditions, tying those receiving the benefits into a state in which they’re forced to remain under the poverty line to continue living comfortably. A mincome UBI would be conditionless, and would not leave the poor in “welfare traps.”

○ Rather than increasing inflation, a UBI would shift funds rather than creating them, not increasing inflation whatsoever.

This article details the benefits of a Universal Basic Income from a pragmatic libertarian’s perspective a few pros listed are:

○ The current social security measures are ineffective at combating poverty. 11.8% of U.S. residents live in poverty (as of 2018 according to the [USCB](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/poverty.html)), despite spending over $668 billion annually. A UBI would be more direct in allocating funds to the destitute, and would be enough to **raise all impoverished people within the U.S. over the poverty line.**

○ As an unconditional grant, a UBI would be uninvasive and wouldn’t include measures preventing those in poverty from receiving the benefits from intrusive tests such as drug tests exempting marijuana users from the assistance of a UBI.

○ There is no objective scale to determine one’s need, so a member of the petty-bourgeois class tends to afford a stronger legal case as to why they “need” the current social security than a member of the working class would. A UBI would benefit **all** working class peoples, due to the nature of a UBI excluding **no one**.

○ A UBI would be less invasive and less presumptuous when it comes to what the recipient needs to purchase with the received income. It would also stop the state from exempting those it doesn’t see as living its preferred lifestyle from measures to prevent poverty.

○ **TEST**: The test included ~2,000 unemployed Finnish Citizens receiving the equivalent of $680 monthly for 2 years, employment would not affect the amount of support participants received.

○ **RESULTS**: Researchers interviewed 81 participants throughout the test, and while results varied, the general consensus was that a UBI is generally effective as a welfare measure for the impoverished. There was a **slight positive correlation between a UBI and employment**, recipients reported **feeling generally happier**, and some participants even claimed the **UBI gave them a chance to “live their dreams.”** Overall, the Finnish UBI experiment proved to be successful, despite some criticisms with the conduction of the experiment.

○ **CRITICISMS**: The test interviewed only 81/2000 participants, being only 4% of the participants; however, there were other forms of questioning present in the study. Another criticism of the test was its short runtime, being only affecting the participants for 2 years. Finally, the test only applied to the already unemployed, showing no results for a UBI applied to the general population. **However, even with these criticisms, the test seems to show a very positive effect if applied to the unemployed**.

● [On the Canadian Prairie, a Basic Income Experiment](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.marketplace.org/2016/12/20/world/dauphin/)

○ **TEST**: In the 1970’s, the Canadian government attempted a 5 year Minimum Basic Income test in the province of Manitoba. The experiment ensured **at least the minimum income a family required to remain comfortable**.

○ **RESULTS**: There was **little impact in the number of people working**, some women stopped working, but the primary reason was to simply take maternity leave to better care for their children. Hospitalization, especially hospitalization caused by mental health issues, declined severely, likely due to lowered stress caused by a fear of a lack of funds. Teens were able to stay in education for longer, not needing to leave high school to support their families. Overall, the experiment proved successful, greatly improving the lives of the recipients of the funds.

○ **TESTS**: Many tests were attempted by both the Canadian and U.S. governments to determine the effects a UBI would have, using different formulas to determine the payment methods of the UBI. The primary concern of the experiments was the “labor supply response,” or, the amount which the total measurable amount of labor done by the participants changed within a given time after implementation of UBI.

○ **RESULTS**: Tests involving Keeley’s method had the most severe results of the labor supply response (an average decline in labor supply response of about seven percent for husbands, about twenty eight percent for wives, and about twenty two percent for single female heads). However, Keeley’s test required eligible participants to have an income less than eleven thousand (single headed) or less than thirteen thousand (double headed), rather than determining eligibility by means by comparing by percentage their incomes to the poverty line. Other U.S. tests of UBI (conducted by Robins and Burtless) impacted the labor supply response less (an average decline in labor supply response of about six percent for husbands, about nineteen percent for wives, and about fifteen percent for single female heads). The results of the “mincome design” tested in Canada are by far the lowest (an average decline in labor supply response of about one percent for men, about three percent for wives, and about seven percent for single female heads). The likely reason for the high negative labor supply response in wives is the UBI allowing them to securely leave their jobs while pregnant or raising a newborn. As for the “sociological” response, while still heavily debated, it was found that a UBI had little to no effect on marriage stability. Other results in sociological response are seen simply as “a welcome bonus” (24), and are not included within this study.

● [India's Basic Income Experiment](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://socialprotection-humanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Indias-Basic-Income-Experiment-PP21.pdf)

○ **TEST**: The experiment applied to families with under $100 worth of income in eight different villages within Madhya Pradesh throughout June of 2011 to November of 2012. Initially, the amount was $2.20 per child and $4.40 per adult per month, however, this amount was increased by 50% in May of 2012 to give more benefit and to account for inflation.

○ **RESULTS**: Many positive effects of the implementation of a UBI were found in this test, especially in regards to general household well-being. Some effects to well-being include, but are not limited to, a reduction from 45% to 19% of affected families reporting food insecurity, an increase from 35.5% of affected households owning beds to an astounding 83%, and an increased phone ownership from 9% to 61%. Economically, the test also considerably impacted the communities. The villages affected by UBI reported at least “small improvement” to attendance in school, reporting up to 52% where the Self Employed Women’s Association was active and up to 72% where they were not. In villages where the UBI was active, time spent doing wage labor declined by over 45.2%, and was heavily replaced by the families engaging in more desirable farming work, whereas in the control tests, **wage labor actually increased.** Finally, in villages with a UBI, decrease in debt was reported more often, from 2% to 6% in villages with Self Employed Women’s Association presence, and from 2% to 17% in villages without.

○ "***SNAP effectively alleviates food insecurity** in terms of caloric, macronutrient, and micronutrient intake. Still, **SNAP participants are struggling more than income-eligible and higher-income nonparticipants to meet key dietary guidelines**. Future policies should ensure that this vital food assistance program addresses diet quality while reducing food insecurity.*"

○ As expected, the impact of SNAP redemptions on employment was greater during the recession period (2008 to 2010) than either the pre-recession period (2001 to 2007) or the postrecession period (2011 to 2014) in both non metro and metro counties. In the recession period, SNAP redemptions contributed to about 1.0 job per $10,000 of additional SNAP redemptions in nonmetro counties and about 0.4 job per $10,000 of additional SNAP redemptions in metro counties.

○ This article restricted the analysis sample to households in sites using the SNAP EBT system and who reported receiving SNAP at baseline, prior to the SEBTC intervention. The analysis showed that although the SEBTC benefit resulted in increases in food expenditures and food security for this group, the SEBTC **SNAP-like benefit resulted in only modest improvements in three of five nutrition outcomes collected by the study that are mostly considered healthy** (fruits and vegetables with and without fried potatoes and dairy products).

○ **Majority of vendors from each market did believe that SNAP increased sales**, but the percentage of increased sales is generally not higher than 5 percent. A potentially more crucial impact of the program is an increase in customer base, **and fewer vendors in each market saw their customer base increase due to SNAP acceptance**. Still, a majority of vendors did feel that the customer base has increased, that number could rise if the amount of promotional materials increased, drawing in new market customers.

○ In conclusion, **access to Medicare insurance was associated with a significant increase in detection of cancers** with recommended screening, **as well as a decline in mortality from these cancers** among women. Our estimates provide new evidence of Medicare's impact on health outcomes for people in need of medical care.

○ This study provides evidence of the impact of the Medicare Part D prescription drug insurance expansion on **mortality for the above-65 population**. Applying a difference in-differences framework that exploits the geographic differences in drug coverage across markets prior to reform, **we find a statistically significant reduction in cardiovascular related deaths, saving between 7,000 and 26,000 lives in its first year**.

○ Conclusion: Medicare Part D has increased access to prescription medications for the elderly. However, continued analysis and research of drug utilization patterns among minorities should be conducted to ensure that all enrollees regardless of race are benefiting equally from Medicare Part D. Identification of these barriers can provide insights on how to improve the program to allow minorities to benefit equally from the Medicare Part D program and remove health inequalities.

○ The nine papers identified in this review report a range of 8–33 minutes of additional physical activity associated with public transport use, with several papers reporting 12–15 minutes. Using bootstrapping analyses, we found that if public transport use by inactive adults was to increase, there would be a significant dose-response increase in the population level of sufficiently active adults in NSW.

○ Detailed analysis of living standards in the USSR, which found that the Soviet Union achieved "Remarkably large and rapid improvements in child height, adult stature and infant mortality," using this data to state that "significant improvements likely occurred in the nutrition, sanitary practices, and public health infrastructure." Also states that "the physical growth record of the Soviet population compares favorably with that of other European countries at a similar level of development in this period." She states that "The conventional measures of GNP growth and household consumption indicate a long, uninterrupted upward climb in the Soviet standard of living from 1928 to 1985; even Western estimates of these measures support this view, albeit at a slower rate of growth than the Soviet measures."In addition, "Both Western and Soviet estimates of GNP growth in the Soviet Union indicate that GNP per capita grew in every decade in the postwar era, at times far surpassing the growth rates of the developed western economies."

○ In-depth comparison of the world's two largest countries by population, one of which is socialist, and the other capitalist. Includes a detailed analysis of China under Mao Zedong, concluding that "the accomplishments relating to education, healthcare, land reforms, and social change in the pre-reform [Maoist] period made significantly positive contributions to the achievements of the post-reform period." It describes Maoist China's "remarkable reduction in chronic undernourishment," stating that "casual processes through which the reduction of undernourishment was achieved involved extensive state action including redistributive policies, nutritional support, and of course health care."

■ Also includes some important remarks related to starvation in each country, saying "it is important to note that despite the gigantic size of excess mortality in the Chinese famine, the extra mortality in India from regular deprivation in normal times vastly overshadows the former...

○ Study which found that Chinese health conditions improved massively as a result of the communist revolution, and began to suffer as a result of the market reforms. As they put it, "China’s progress on communicable disease control (CDC) in the 30 years after establishment of the People’s Republic in 1949 is widely regarded as remarkable. Life expectancy soared by around 30 years, infant mortality plummeted and smallpox, sexually transmitted diseases and many other infections were either eliminated or decreased massively in incidence, largely as a result of CDC. By the mid-1970's, China was already undergoing the epidemiological transition, years ahead of other nations of similar economic status... These people-focused approaches broke down with China’s market reforms from 1980." This has important implications for the debate over economic and medical policy in China.

○ Study on healthcare conditions in the PPR, which found that "Before World War II (WWII) Poland was one of the countries with the poorest health in Europe... The health transformation that took place in Poland after WWII proceeded very rapidly. Control of infectious diseases and infant mortality became a state priority in the post-war Polish People’s Republic. The epidemiological transition that in the United Kingdom or Germany took almost a century, in Poland, and many other Central and East European (CEE) countries, occurred in the two decades following WWII. This process led the CEE region to almost closing the health gap dividing it from Western Europe in the 1960's. Life expectancy in Poland increased to 70 years and infant mortality decreased to 30 deaths per 1000 live births." However, these positive achievements were later offset by excessive smoking and drinking, as well as other man-made health risks which significantly harmed the health of the Polish people. This provides an important case study for socialists to study..

○ Study by G.I. Khanin (an esteemed Russian economist), which found that the Soviet economy outperformed the capitalist nations in numerous ways, and that the revisionist reforms put into place after Stalin's death played a large role in the system's slowdown. As he puts it, "Compared with the later period it is justifiable to talk of the indisputable advantages of the command over the market economy in Russian conditions... these advantages are evident even in comparison with the degenerate mid-1980's version of the command economy, which was very different from the classical model." He also contradicts the common claim that the Soviet economy under Stalin was inefficient, noting "The USSR economy also exceeded the main capitalist countries in this period in terms of a number of indicators of economic efficiency."

○ Study which found that the disparity between East and West Germany was primarily the result of factors which predated the establishment of socialism in the GDR. As they put it, "the “Great Divergence” between East and West in industrial efficiency did not begin in 1948, when the institutional development of the two parts of the country took fundamentally different paths. The main factors contributing to this divergence were already present earlier." In addition, they argue that " communism could actually accelerate industrial restructuring... This is reflected in the fact that, as shown in table 6, labor-productivity growth in East German industry accelerated after 1948, at least temporarily." In other words the gap between East and West Germany formed *before* socialism took effect, and if anything, socialism helped to narrow the gap.

○ Study by Robert Thurston (Professor of History at Miami University at Ohio), which found that Soviet workers had strong and well-protected rights to criticize officials and participate in decision-making, particularly at the factory level. As he says, "at the lower levels of society, in day-to-day affairs and the implementation of policy, [the Soviet system] was participatory." While there were limits to criticism, Thurston notes that "such bounds allowed a great deal that was deeply significant to workers, including some aspects of production norms, pay rates and classifications, safety on the job, housing, and treatment by managers. This occurred at a time when American workers in particular were struggling for basic union recognition, which even when won did not provide much formal influence at the workplace."

○ Robert W. Thurston, professor emeritus at Miami University (Ohio), thoroughly debunks the claims of Robert Conquest (and other reactionary historians) on the Stalin-period of the USSR, stating "Stalin, the press, and the Stakhanovite movement all regularly encouraged ordinary people to criticize those in authority." He points out that many arrests in the 1930's were actually late punishments for genuine offenses, such as serving in the White Army during the Civil War. Thuston also puts forth the question "If the citizenry was supposed to be terrorized and stop thinking, why encourage criticism and input from below on a large scale?" He also states that "my evidence suggests that widespread fear did not exist in the case at hand [the Soviet "Great Terror" period]".

○ Investigates the extent of coercion and force in Stalin's USSR, concluding that "Stalin did not intend to terrorize the country and did not need to rule by fear. Memoirs and interviews with Soviet people indicate that many more believed in Stalin's quest to eliminate internal enemies than were frightened by it." The book also shows that "between 1934 and 1936 police and court practice relaxed significantly. Then a series of events, together with the tense international situation and memories of real enemy activity during the savage Russian Civil War, combined to push leaders and people into a hysterical hunt for perceived 'wreckers.' After late 1938, however, the police and courts became dramatically milder."

■ One of the book's more interesting comments, specifically relating to Stalin: "There was never a long period of Stalinism without a serious foreign threat, major internal dislocation, or both, which makes identifying its true nature impossible." One of the more interesting statements from a bourgeois historian on Stalin, acknowledging that the repression of the Stalin period, far from being the casual whim of the man himself, emerged as a mass response to genuine threats.

■ *“Most of the major policy actions in 2018—including the escalation of the trade war with China; diplomatic engagement with North Korea; and extensive deregulation of the energy, mining, and automotive industries—have not required congressional approval. Moreover, [President Donald] Trump has repeatedly called into question the independence and competence of the U.S. judicial system with regard to the ongoing federal investigation, led by Robert Mueller, into potential ties between Mr. Trump's presidential campaign and Russia, and various courts' efforts to block some of his policy orders, particularly regarding immigration. Although we expect the U.S. system of checks and balances to remain intact, this internal conflict risks further undermining public confidence in institutions. As a result, the score for political culture declined in the 2018 index.”*

○ **Electoral college discourages non-battleground state voters from going out to vote** - “*Overall, the percentage of voters who participated in last fall's election was almost 5 percent higher than the turnout in 2000.

## Common Myths:
This [webpage](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.nationalpopularvote.com/answering-myths) provides a far more detailed rebuttal to pro-EC points, so give it a look! A lot of points made here are also made on this other [webpage](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College), which you can go back to for easier reference.

**CLAIM: Without an electoral college system, candidates would just pander to the biggest cities and biggest states while completely ignoring smaller states and rural areas. With the EC, people in small, flyover states will not be disenfranchised and will have more of a say on the national stage.**

● If you entirely win over every single voter of the top 10 biggest cities, you’ve only won 8% of the popular vote - far from enough to win an election. Even adding on a 100% win for every single one of the next 90 biggest cities, you’ve still only reached 19% of the whole population - again, nowhere close enough to win an election. This means that if a candidate appealed ONLY to the interests of big cities, they would lose in a landslide every time to a candidate with the popular vote. ([source](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wC42HgLA4k))

● Smaller states are already ignored with the EC, [with the focus instead being on swing states](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.fairvote.org/yet-again-just-three-states-draw-the-majority-of-campaign-attention-presidential-tracker-update-october-17-201). This isn’t surprising, either - in a system where some states are safely in the hands of a campaign while other states are up for grabs, campaigns gain more electoral votes by focusing on states which are easier to grab for themselves rather than trying to snatch a safe state from the hands of the opposing campaign. This bears out in the data, too - [in 2004](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:2004CampaignAttention_\(edit\).png), the last 5 weeks of campaigning was spent in a select few swing states. Similar results came out of 2008, [2012](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.fairvote.org/fairvote-maps-the-2012-presidential-campaign), and in [2016](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Lxw0vc4YBUwQ8cZouyewZvOGg6PyzS2mArWNe3iJcY/edit%23gid=0) (some analysis of the 2016 data [here](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://theweek.com/articles/840362/electoral-college-doesnt-benefit-small-states-what-does-even-dumber)).

● This is essentially advocating for affirmative action for smaller states, which should be especially concerning to people who usually put out anti-affirmative action arguments: conservatives.

● If you don’t want some people in California deciding life for Wyomingans that’s fine, that’s a reasonable position to have - but the EC doesn’t really fix this so much as it pushes the situation closer to being flipped - Wyoming’s chosen candidate deciding life for Californians. A better way to stop this cross-regional influence would be to localize most power, so that the local governments and state government of Wyoming has more say over its own policy than the federal government does.

**CLAIM: Democracy, aka mob rule, is bad. The EC is not based in democracy, though.**

● The EC is still based on a democratic vote, the only real difference being that the EC skews the democratic vote based on what state you live in. By this point, it’s more likely that you have a problem with democratic voting than you do with specific implementations of it.

● There are literally thousands of examples of democracy being successful within the US, primarily in the form of mayors, governors, and so on. If you extend that back historically, you’ll get hundreds of thousands of examples to choose from - and that’s just within the US. These local or state governments haven’t collapsed or been hindered by a popular vote being used there, as far as we can tell. By and large, we see the same play out across [the overwhelming majority of countries in the world, which elect their head of state via national popular vote](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Electoral_systems_for_heads_of_state_map.svg), rather than via an electoral college or equivalent. The countries that do have political, economic, etc unrest would likely not see their problems resolved by replacing their national popular vote system with an electoral college.

● A bare majority still usually has an advantage in EC - usually the person with the most votes also wins the EC. If your intention is to prevent the mob of the majority from tyrannizing the minority, the EC is a horrible solution.

○ Keep in mind that this doesn’t invalidate the movement to remove the EC, though - the process by which a president is chosen is very important, and even one election in which the popular vote and EC diverge will still matter a lot for the country’s future. For example, Donald Trump’s court appointees [will likely reshape federal courts for decades](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/10/trump-legacy-conservative-judges-district-courts), despite him only being a one-term president. [You could also argue that wrong winner elections aren’t as rare as you might think](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.nationalpopularvote.com/section_9.3) and will likely be more common as elections since the 1980s have been pretty close races.

**CLAIM: Without the EC, what you’re essentially left with is ‘two wolves and a lamb deciding what to eat for dinner’. Non-EC democracy makes it much easier to oppress the minority vote, while the EC prevents the majority from tyrannizing the minority.**

● Knowing how the EC can allow the candidate with the most votes to lose, this metaphor applied to the EC could very well be ‘one wolf and two lambs deciding what to eat for dinner’ with the wolf, not the lambs, having the final say. The minority - in this case, the wolf - would have more of a say than the lambs. Even if you fully accept that there’s a problem with tyranny of the majority, you still have to admit that the electoral college sometimes replaces tyranny by majority with tyranny by minority ([and that ‘sometimes’ is getting more likely to happen given because close elections have been more common as of late](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.nationalpopularvote.com/section_9.3)). As it turns out, the criticisms made of “tyranny of the majority” can usually be more strongly pushed against “tyranny of the minority”.

● The EC wasn’t implemented with the foresight of knowing where minorities would be located nowadays; its method of designating power does not keep racial, ethnic, class, etc. minorities in mind whatsoever. It’s simply blind to those aspects of the population’s makeup.

○ Even if the EC was originally designed to protect a certain minority group, there’s no good reason for the designers to assume that it would still protect that certain minority group today. They can’t just predict the demographic makeup and geographic distribution of the US 350 years into the future.

● The EC also doesn’t have any mechanism built into it which is able to specifically target candidates with bad or oppressive policies - all it really does is weigh your vote differently based on what state you live in. If a majority of electoral votes are cast in favor of someone with really bad and oppressive policies, that’s that.

● A bare majority still usually has an advantage in EC - usually the person with the most votes also wins the EC. If your intention is to prevent the majority from tyrannizing the minority, the EC is a horrible solution.

○ Keep in mind that this doesn’t invalidate the movement to remove the EC, though - the process by which a president is chosen is very important, and even one election in which the popular vote and EC diverge will still matter a lot for the country’s future. For example, Donald Trump’s court appointees [will likely reshape federal courts for decades](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/10/trump-legacy-conservative-judges-district-courts), despite him only being a one-term president. [You could also argue that wrong winner elections aren’t as rare as you might think](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.nationalpopularvote.com/section_9.3) and will likely be more common as elections since the 1980s have been pretty close races.

● What about situations in which all sides have the same interests, don't intend to harm each other, but just have different solutions to the same goal? The 2 wolves and a lamb example doesn't work there, as neither side necessarily wants to harm the other. This sort of situation usually plays out at state-level or local politics though, where partisan tensions are less prevalent and people are more able to unify on issues.

**CLAIM: The EC system is fine because swing states change and they change often.**

● The fact that swing states change shouldn't be used to dismiss the broader populace in favor of those who happen to live in swing states in a particular year.

● The correlation between expected swing states and voter turnout is rather strong, suggesting that [voters who are not in swing states are still discouraged from voting](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.npr.org/2016/11/26/503170280/charts-is-the-electoral-college-dragging-down-voter-turnout-in-your-state) as they feel that their vote counts less. This depression could be explained by other things which are also related to the electoral college, e.g. where campaigns choose to focus on getting the vote out.

**CLAIM: The EC makes it harder to steal elections. In EC, votes have to be stolen in certain places at certain times, whereas the popular vote system makes them stealable no matter where you are.**

● Under EC, it usually takes fewer votes to flip a few strategic states than it takes to flip the popular vote - [the outcome of a state election hinging on 10,000 votes is around 4% vs 0.1% in a national popular election](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-10-31/what-are-the-odds-of-a-disputed-election-higher-than-they-should-be) - and keep in mind that 4% applies to each state individually, rather than the national election as a whole. In this way, the EC makes voter fraud more dangerous than the NPV.

● In recent times, the margins needed to flip individual states (and thus the election) have been pretty close. Every single time, it comes in contrast with the much larger margin that would be needed to flip the national popular vote.

○ In 2000, it would have taken 537 votes in Florida to flip the whole election’s result, as opposed to several hundred thousand votes which would have been needed to flip the national popular vote.

○ In 2004, you would have had to flip around 50,000 votes in the single state of Ohio to change the result of the entire 2004 election in favor of John Kerry, who lost the popular vote by over 3 million votes. Note that in this particular instance, the EC would have benefitted a democrat, not a republican.

○ In 2016, it would have taken less than 100,000 votes distributed across PA, WI, and MI to change the election outcome, rather than nearly 3 million votes to change the popular vote count.

● This assumes that voter fraud is a big issue in the first place, [which it isn’t really at this point](https://archive.ph/uY9Yr#h.rv4rtht8apoo). And no, the EC is not the reason why voter fraud is no big deal.

● By using this argument, you kind of accidentally admit that your vote only really matters if it’s cast in a swing state. Your argument would assume that fraud doesn't matter if it's cast in a safe state but that it would matter in a swing state.

**CLAIM: The founding fathers were wary of pure democracy, and didn’t want to see it in America. The founding fathers are very smart and wise, so it’s best that we keep with their original system and avoid making changes.**

● If we’re using the standards set by the founding fathers as the ultimate guide for our country simply because the founding fathers proposed it, we should also embrace stuff like disenfranchising women and minorities, slavery should maybe be legalized, and we should have only property-owning white men vote. However, our country has evolved and moved more towards fulfilling beliefs of equality and democracy over time, and in the process we’ve worked towards the abolition of slavery, the granting of more rights to women, and overall a more egalitarian society. Sure, the founding fathers set up a good system to start with, but their word is by no means the final say on the subject (again, it wasn't and still isn't a static system).

● Keep in mind that treating the founding fathers as some sort of monolith in their beliefs is dumb, especially considering that there’s nuance even to the beliefs of individual founders. This is true for issues like slavery for instance, where many of them (not all) owned slaves and took few meaningful steps to end the practice, yet most of these people (not all) still opposed the practice. You can’t just take this info as an indication that the founding fathers as a whole liked or disliked slavery - there’s too much nuance for that. For stuff regarding the founding fathers as a whole group, there’s way more nuance than people like to admit, especially when they want to use it for a talking point about how “this important group supported [thing I like].”

● The EC, as well as America’s voting system in general, has not been a static system - even when the founding fathers were still alive and had considerable influence. This means that the founding fathers themselves recognized that the original system wasn’t perfect and that changes would sometimes be needed. To name a few examples of changes that happened:

○ For over half a century in the US, many states simply did not hold a vote for the general populace and instead just had their electors cast electoral votes. In the [1788-9 presidential election](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PresidentialCounty1788Colorbrewer.gif) only Pennsylvania and Maryland had a vote, most states didn’t have a vote until [1824](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PresidentialCounty1824Colorbrewer.png), and a couple states like South Carolina went on without a vote [for even longer](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PresidentialCounty1848Colorbrewer.gif). Modern proponents of the EC don’t advocate for getting rid of statewide-votes, even though the country started out with very few state-wide votes.

○ In 1870, the original [Three-fifths Compromise](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-fifths_Compromise) was abandoned in favor of granting black people full suffrage via the [15th Amendment](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution). Modern proponents of the EC don’t advocate for going back to the original system in this regard, even though it was a system reached by the founding fathers themselves.

○ After the 1800 election (just 4 elections into the country’s history), the [12th Amendment](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelfth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) was passed which directly altered the way that electors were able to cast their votes. This forced electors to cast one vote for president and one for vice president, rather than be able to cast both votes for just president or just vice president. More context about the 12th amendment is provided [here](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://uselectionatlas.org/INFORMATION/INFORMATION/electcollege_history.php).

**CLAIM: The smaller states literally provide food for the bigger states. They play an invaluable role in the economy, so they should have an outsized share of the vote in elections like what the EC gives them.**

● Farmland isn't just a small state thing - many big states like California and Illinois have a lot of farmland, yet are both large states. Why should Illinois and California, which have a lot of farmland and a sizable rural population, have to suffer because other states are the same except smaller?

● There's a number of indicators that show small, rural counties fare worse with economic stuff. For example, big and urban places [tend to pay more into the federal government than they take out](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://external-preview.redd.it/eBuDrkIah9UKDtvsoHAnV4YTZZN1oXJaVGE6lVlDPIk.jpg?auto=webp&s=485d0bd0dae95fd484260666885290310f666dd1) while smaller, more rural places are the opposite. More urban, Biden-voting counties [make up a solid majority of the country’s economic output](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2020/11/09/biden-voting-counties-equal-70-of-americas-economy-what-does-this-mean-for-the-nations-political-economic-divide/) even though Trump won more counties overall - including most small, rural counties. However, nobody uses stuff like this to argue that people in small, rural counties should have a disproportionately small say in elections.

● Most states are a mix of farmland and cities - SC, PA, NC, OH, AL, TN, NY, KS, NE, and so on. Some of these states are big (OH, NY, NC) and some are small (KS, NE). The idea that most states are either “all urban” or “all rural”, which is somewhat implied with the claim, is just false.
# **Gerrymandering**
● [Committee for Economic Development 18](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ced.org/reports/solving-the-problem-of-partisan-gerrymandering%23section4)

○ “An analysis of districting plans conducted by [Professor Simon Jackman of Stanford University](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://campaignlegal.org/sites/default/files/Jackman-WHITFORD%20V.%20NICHOL-Report_0.pdf), which encompassed 786 state legislative elections in 41 states in the period from 1972–2014, found that the maps approved in the most recent redistricting cycle exhibited some of the worst partisan asymmetries at both the congressional and state level in the past 40 years.”

■ For instance, despite Republicans only winning 48.6% of the votes in the 2012 Wisconsin elections, they were still able to win 60 out of 99 state legislature seats because of the redistricting plan they implemented.

○ “According to an analysis of the 2016 US House races by the [Associated Press](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://apnews.com/fa6478e10cda4e9cbd75380e705bd380/Analysis-indicates-partisan-gerrymandering-has-benefited-GOP), the Republicans gained as many as 22 additional US House seats as compared to the average vote share in congressional districts due to the partisan advantage achieved through the districting process.”

● [Legal Defense and Education Fund 18](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.naacpldf.org/case-issue/prison-based-gerrymandering-reform/)

○ “Prison-based gerrymandering” occurs where state and local governments count the number of incarcerated citizens to inflate the population count to receive more districts, despite the incarcerated citizens not being able to vote; such a practice violates the notion of “one person, once vote”

○ Disproportionately harms communities of color, as African-Americans represent 41.3% of our prison population

○ Rural communities also use their incarcerated population to increase their political influence, as they only make up 20% of the U.S. population, but host 40% of all incarcerated persons. Additionally, states with predominantly rural areas are more likely to deny incarcerated persons voting rights.

● [Uggen and Manza 2002](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.jstor.org/stable/3088970)

○ Expanding suffrage to felons would have reversed the results of as many as seven senate races and at least one presidential election.

■ “Assuming that Democrats who might have been elected in the absence of felon disenfranchisement had held their seats as long as the Republicans who narrowly defeated them, we estimate that the Democratic Party would have gained parity in 1984 and held majority control of the U.S. Senate from 1986 to [2002].”

■ Bush’s victory in 2000 against Al Gore would have been reversed as well

■ “Disenfranchised felons and ex-felons currently make up 2.28 percent of the voting-age population”; “because the margin of victory in 3 of the last 10 presidential elections has been 1.1 percent of the voting-age population or less, felon disenfranchisement could be a decisive factor in future presidential races.”

**GENERAL RACE/RACISM**
# **Racism Misconceptions**
**CLAIM: How does institutional racism explain disparities?**

● To understand how institutional racism explains disparities, it must first be understood that institutional racism is situated within a conceptual framework which acknowledges the role of racialisation. There are both conceptual and political advantages to adopting this conceptualisation. Analytically, according to Rattansi 2005, racialisation provides a multi-layered and multi-dimensional frame. It can encapsulate statements which explicitly denigrate or assume the inferiority of racialised groups as well as the more implicit common sense understandings which exist within institutions. Its dynamic, as opposed to static nature, allows the intersections of race with class, gender, sexuality and nation to be incorporated into any empirical investigation, as (Rattansi, [2005](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-social-policy/article/institutional-racism-and-ethnic-inequalities-an-expanded-multilevel-framework/CC0299D0168307C7F6ED1FD891D74245%23ref68): 290) makes clear. Basically, in this regard, it accommodates intersectional understandings which recognise the significance of seeing individuals as multiply positioned, with each identity (race/ethnicity, gender or class) irreducible to a discrete category or experience. These multiple axes of differentiation and interacting levels of disadvantage and discrimination produce complex social relations (Crenshaw, [1993](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-social-policy/article/institutional-racism-and-ethnic-inequalities-an-expanded-multilevel-framework/CC0299D0168307C7F6ED1FD891D74245%23ref17); [Brah, Phoenix, Taylor, Gillborn and Ladson-Billings 2009](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-social-policy/article/institutional-racism-and-ethnic-inequalities-an-expanded-multilevel-framework/CC0299D0168307C7F6ED1FD891D74245%23ref10)). Analytically, such an approach can also better appreciate internal differentiation which avoids essentializing experience and recognises its historically and spatially contingent nature. This multilevel framework of racialisation at micro, meso, and macro levels (which includes institutional racialisation) can be applied to explain ethnic inequalities.

**CLAIM: There are only individuals racists, not the system.**

● It’s kind of a reductive view to just say “oh well if individual ppl are racist against a certain group of ppl, is the system racist?'' I mean systems are made of individuals, those individuals have implicit biases against certain groups of people then it’s kinda obvious that those people would have a direct link to a disproportionate outcome between two races. Before we point out specific people, we need to address the racist cultures, racist laws, and racist policies that produce racist individuals. There are four dimensions of racism: internalized, which speaks to your beliefs; interpersonal, which speaks to your behavior; institutional, which speaks to your organizational culture, and structural, which speaks to society. You can't reduce these problems to individuals because you otherwise ignore the complexities of race; you obscure the four dimensions of racism.

● **But racism has to be intentional!**

○ The concept of institutional racism emphasizes non-intentionality and normal institutional procedures. 'Institutional racism is in its most profound instances, covert, resulting from acts of indifference, omission and refusal to challenge the status quo' (Spears, 1978: 29). Distinctions need to be made between (a) those activities which are clearly racialist and supported by racist justifications, and (b) those activities which are in origin non-racialist and are justified by non-racist ideologies and (c) those activities which are non-racialist but are based upon unconscious or unadmitted racist justifications. What is important is that we keep an open mind about the relationship between racist intent, racial expression in practices and racial effect, i.e. forms of inequality. (a) Racist belief need not necessarily result in racially discriminatory practices and racial inequalities. (b) Racially discriminatory practices need not be justified in racist terms in order to produce unequal outcomes. (c) Racially discriminatory practices may continue after their racist justifications have been abandoned. (d) Racial inequality may be the result of other factors than intentional discrimination. Unless these different scenarios are accepted, then it is suggested that policies to alter racially discriminatory practices and institutional processes will either fail because they are based on a false set of assumptions or arouse an unnecessary backlash when people deny both their racist intents or their unconscious racism! If individuals are racist because of their uncritical participation in racist institutions, then this is the result of their actions rather than their intentions. It doesn’t matter the intent of individuals, it doesn’t matter whether individuals are racist or not, what matters is the outcome. If the system leads to an outcome that is disproportionate between two people (even when we are accounting for variables other than race) we can conclude that there is some barrier preventing one race from being successful over another race. And in this case it’s white people being more successful than black people when it comes to employment, sentencing, and in many other areas. In fact, accordingly a statistical approach geared toward testing whether race caused someone to behave differently has no necessary relation to the core elements in a disparate impact claim. As the Supreme Court noted in Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust, “[t]he factual issues and the character of the evidence are inevitably somewhat different when the plaintiff is exempted from the need to prove intentional discrimination.” Additionally, [McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_Corp._v._Green), 411 U.S. 792 (1973) showed that discriminatory intent can be shown through indirect or circumstantial evidence.

**CLAIM: I don’t see color/a color-blind society will fix racism.**

● Although this assertion sounds intuitively plausible, the reality is that color-blind policies often put racial minorities at a disadvantage. For instance, all else being equal, color-blind seniority systems tend to protect White workers against job layoffs, because senior employees are usually White. Likewise, color-blind college admissions favor White students because of their earlier educational advantages. Unless pre-existing inequities are corrected or otherwise taken into account, color-blind policies do not correct racial injustice—they reinforce it. [https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9780801426223/racism-and-justice/](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9780801426223/racism-and-justice/)

● In an ideal society, we would get to live colorblind, in which race has no meaning or impact whatsoever. However, we do not live in a color blind society so we should not act like race is insignificant. Ignoring the problems in our society does not make them automatically go away; rather, it allows these problems to fester while we do nothing about it. This is particularly the case for implicit bias, which will still exist even if we deny that it does.

● Taking on a fully colorblind approach also neglects the role that racist policies and history have had in shaping our present. We are not detached from our past, but rather we are the product of it. As a result of past discrimination, [we see communities and subdivisions divided up by race](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.forbes.com/sites/rakeenmabud/2019/12/04/history-and-housing-discrimination-why-neighborhoods-in-the-united-states-are-still-so-segregated/) (an artifact of past segregation), [inequalities in wealth and opportunity](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://oprhc.org/2016/08/how-segregation-creates-chronic-unemployment-poverty-traps-and-crime/) (a lasting result of discrimination past and present, among other things), and so on. Implementing a colorblind agenda RIGHT NOW would obviously not address the consequences of past racism, instead opting to ignore those consequences and shout "racism!" at anyone who actually does try to address those consequences.

● **When they reference Morgan Freeman saying “stop talking about it.”**

○ Black history is not taught as it pertains to America. American history holds all of us but we're not all treated like Americans.

**CLAIM: Disparity ≠ Discrimination**

● **NBA/NFL comparison**

○ First of all, the NBA literally used to [block black players](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/kidspost/in-nbas-early-years-black-players-werent-welcome/2017/02/15/664aa92e-f1fc-11e6-b9c9-e83fce42fb61_story.html) in its early years. This is not a valid comparison because there's no point of human treatment and racism has to have a subject and an object in which both are humans/human institutions. The NBA and NFL are just demographics. A demographic in and of itself can't be racist. The point of action where someone either interacts with an institution or another human being, that's when it's racist. There's not enough information to conclude whether the NBA or NFL is racist. Who’s hired in the NBA and NFL comes down to beating the clock, scoring, and yardage. Those three things have no opinions nor feelings.

● Critiques on Thomas Sowell’s “Disparity ≠ Discrimination”

○ The claim “disparity ≠ discrimination” is just a slogan, not a conclusion derived from dispassionate and comprehensive empirical research and reflection. Disparities can be produced by any number of causes, which certainly include –but are by no means limited to– discrimination. The fact that some or even many disparities are not caused by discrimination does not prove that discrimination can never be inferred, or even that it usually can’t. All it proves is that discrimination cannot be inferred from disparities 100% of the time, which is obviously true anyway. The truth is that discrimination or bias is usually not inferable from a single statistic standing alone. A single statistic is a snapshot, showing one view of a situation from one angle. To show causation for an inequality, something more is needed. That can come from a comprehensive battery of statistics, showing the situation from many different views and many different angles. Or it can come from nonstatistical evidence such as narratives of discrimination. A multilayered examination like this is considered probative not only among social scientists and statisticians, but also in law.

■ “Sowell is correct that intentional racial discrimination (according to Sowell’s classification, Discrimination 1b and 2) at a given juncture — say, racial discrimination by an employer — cannot fully explain Black-White racial disparities in economic outcomes. It does not follow, however, that therefore the remaining racial disparity not explained by acute racial discrimination is not caused by racism in society. Sowell concludes that, for instance, employers and realtors and bankers will make choices about hiring or real estate or loans based on the relevant qualities the individual brings to the table, such as education, credit scores, criminal or eviction history, and so on (this is what he calls Discrimination 1a). People have differences in the quantity and quality of these they can bring to the table, and thus it is perfectly reasonable to find inequalities in economic outcomes. What is not answered by this, however, is why these inequalities would be unevenly distributed by race. It’s certainly not a realtor’s fault that there is a Black-White disparity in credit score, but that difference is not a natural fact of the universe. I and most other social scientists believe that there is inherited inequality from the entire history of American social life that at least in part accounts for why the distribution of these sorts of things are unequal by race. The literature on inherited racial inequalities in sociology, economics, and history is simply massive and cannot be hand-waved away. As it stands, Sowell’s argument on this point is hopelessly endogenous.”

■ “A more interesting question is what drives these disparities. Several times, Sowell compares the uneven distribution of favorable outcomes in the population to the uneven distribution of phenomena like tornadoes — implying that the status quo may simply reflect the natural order of things. He begins the book with a lengthy discussion of how success typically requires many prerequisites (e.g. intelligence, effort, living in a place with good institutions), and the absence of any one can mean failure. This, he claims, means it should not be surprising that success is not evenly distributed. Even if the underlying prerequisites are randomly distributed, the distribution of who is successful will be highly skewed, with only a small share of people having all the prerequisites necessary for success. What Sowell does not discuss is that random distribution of the prerequisites would not produce outcomes that are correlated with traits such as race. The fact that black residents of the U.S. suffer far worse outcomes than white residents implies that the probabilities that these various prerequisites are satisfied vary by race. Some have argued that this is due to differences in genetic makeup; to his credit, Sowell does not make this argument, and in fact seeks to provide an alternative explanation. But if outcomes are correlated with race then this necessarily implies that underlying opportunities or circumstances must be distributed in a way that is correlated with race. Sowell argues that this is not necessarily due to malice, and that is certainly true. But such outcomes also cannot simply be due to chance. This position – that racial disparities are due to random chance – is odd in part because it seems to blatantly ignore societal realities, and also because it does not seem necessary for the arguments that follow. While noting repeatedly that he is not ruling out Discrimination 1b (statistical discrimination in which they match unobservable characteristics and observable race to make a decision) and 2 (outright being racist based on one’s race), Sowell spends much of the book arguing that most existing disparities are due to Discrimination 1a — that is, accurate sorting of applicants by employers, banks, and so on. Disparities based on accurate sorting on traits like educational attainment can be due to unequal opportunity — say, less access to good schools as a child. Differences in opportunity are not an employer’s fault or responsibility, but are also not natural phenomena. They should direct us to address those childhood disparities as the way to reduce adult disparities. Ignoring this implication serves only to deny our power to change the status quo.”

■ “However, disparities arising from such decisions (discrimination 1a, making decisions based on qualities) have what lawyers would refer to as a ‘disparate impact’ on disadvantaged groups, and this can be used as evidence of discrimination in legal settings.)”

**CLAIM: Show me a law or policy that is racist in intent.**

● The problem with this argument is that it assumes “in order for systemic racism to exist then it must be codified within the law” when in reality systemic racism exists in a variety of social contexts and the law because systemic racism is de facto, not de jure. The laws don’t reference race because they don’t need to. The basic structural layout of the US means that Black populations can be disproportionately harmed by a theoretically and ostensibly race neutral measure.

● A bit off-topic but here’s a fun gotcha for conservatives/republicans when it comes to laws with racist intent: many republicans argue both that systemic racism ended in the 60s (with the civil rights acts) and that the [1994 crime bill](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_Crime_Control_and_Law_Enforcement_Act) (which Joe Biden contributed significantly to) was racist and had a racist impact (because Joe Biden is racist). The gotcha comes when you ask them if the crime bill was racist, answering yes suggests that racist legislation was implemented in 1994, much more recently than the 60s. That starts to open questions about what other laws we might be forgetting about which have come about since the 60s.

● **Oxford dictionary definition of racism argument**

○ “Dictionaries are often treated as the final arbiter in arguments over a word's meaning, but they are not always well suited for settling disputes. The lexicographer's role is to explain how words are (or have been) actually used, not how some may feel that they should be used, and they say nothing about the intrinsic nature of the thing named or described by a word, much less the significance it may have for individuals. When discussing concepts like racism, therefore, it is prudent to recognize that quoting from a dictionary is unlikely to either mollify or persuade the person with whom one is arguing.” [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/racism](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/racism)

**CLAIM: White privilege isn’t real, American privilege is.**

● Invoking American privilege, seems to undermine the larger argument because it actively acknowledges that a person can have a level of privilege as a result of arbitrary factors that you yourself might not be in control of. In this case it’s nationality but by that logic why not then race? Secondarily, when you look at the data, it’s really hard to make a case that there isn’t a level of privilege afforded to white Americans.

**CLAIM: Black privilege is real.**

● Even if this were true, this undermines the argument because it actively acknowledges that a black person can have a level of privilege as a result of arbitrary factors that they might not be in control of.

# **Subconscious Bias**
**Even disregarding forms of overt racism, subconscious bias has been demonstrated by a number of studies and undoubtedly affects others forms of discrimination against black people. Neuroscience studies have shown that different regions of the brain are activated in conscious versus unconscious processing, suggesting that unconscious processes are distinct mental activities. Implicit biases are more likely to drive behavior under conditions of ambiguity, high time pressures and cognitive loads, or inattentiveness to the task.**

○ Analyzes “trends in racial and ethnic discrimination in both rental and sales market” since the 1970s

○ “*When well-qualified minority homeseekers contact housing providers to inquire about recently advertised housing units, they generally are just as likely as equally qualified white homeseekers to get an appointment and learn about at least one available housing unit. **However, when differences in treatment occur, white homeseekers are more likely to be favored than minorities. Most important, minority homeseekers are told about and shown fewer homes and apartments than whites***”

○ Black renters who contact agents about recently advertised housing units learn about **11.4 percent fewer available units than equally qualified whites and are shown 4.2 percent fewer units**.

○ Black homebuyers are **2.4 percentage points more likely than equally qualified whites to be denied an in-person appointment.**

○ Black homebuyers who contact agents about recently advertised homes for sale learn about **17.0 percent fewer available homes than equally qualified whites and are shown 17.7 percent fewer homes.**

○ White renters experience more favorable treatment than equally well-qualified blacks in **28.4 percent of inquiries, compared to 19.6 percent in which blacks are favored.** 

■ Consequently, black renters learn about **11.4 percent fewer available units than equally qualified whites (0.20 fewer per inquiry on average) and are shown 4.2 percent fewer units (0.06 fewer per inquiry).**

○ Almost half the time, one tester is told about at least one more unit than his or her partner, with whites 9.0 percentage points more likely than comparable blacks to be told about more available units. Over all tests, blacks learn about 0.2 fewer available units per visit than whites. (Among tests in which the white tester is told about more available units, the difference in the number of units averages 1.68 units; among tests in which the black tester is told about more available units, the difference averages 1.40 units.)

■ This means that, over five in-person visits to rental agents, a black homeseeker would learn about one fewer available unit than a comparable white.

○ One tester is shown more units than the other; in these cases, whites are 2.8 percentage points more likely than blacks to be favored. As a result, whites are shown 0.04 more units than blacks on average. (Among tests in which the white tester is shown more available units, the difference in the number of units shown averages 1.27 units; among tests in which the black tester is shown more available units, the difference averages 1.22 units.)

■ This means that over 25 visits to agents where units are available, a black homeseeker would be shown one fewer available unit than a comparable white.

■ In addition, blacks are shown units with more housing quality problems than equally qualified white homeseekers—0.05 more problem conditions per unit on average.

○ Specifically, white homebuyers experience more favorable treatment than equally well-qualified blacks in 40.7 percent of inquiries, compared with 30.9 percent in which blacks are favored.

■ Consequently, black homebuyers who contact agents about recently advertised homes for sale learn about 17.0 percent fewer available homes than equally qualified whites (0.53 fewer per inquiry on average) and are shown 17.7 percent fewer (0.32 fewer per inquiry).

○ However, in 8 of every 10 tests, more homes are recommended to one tester than the other, and in these cases, whites are 13.4 percentage points more likely than comparable black homebuyers to be favored.

■ These differences mean that on average, whites learn about 0.50 more available homes per test. (Among tests in which the white tester is told about more homes, the difference in the number of homes averages 3.30; among tests in which the black tester is told about more homes, the difference averages 3.11.)

● This means that for every two visits to a sales agent, a black homebuyer learns about one fewer available home than an equally qualified white homebuyer.

● In 1968, the Fair Housing Act (FHA) was signed into law to eliminate the effects of state-sanctioned racial segregation. But it failed to change the status quo as the United States remained nearly segregated as in the 1960s. A newer discriminating lending practice was subprime lending in the 1990s. Lenders targeted high-interest subprime loans to low-income and minority neighborhoods who might be eligible for fair-interest prime loans. Securitization, mortgage brokers and other non-deposit lenders, and legislative deregulation of the mortgage lending industry all played a role in promoting the subprime lending market.

● The long-outlawed practice of redlining (in which banks choke off lending to minority communities) recently re-emerged as a concern for federal bank regulators in New York and Connecticut. A settlement with the Justice Dept and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was the largest in the history of both agencies, topping $33 million in restitution for the practice from New Jersey's largest savings bank. The bank had been accused of steering clear of higher crime neighborhoods and favoring whites in granting loans and mortgages, finding that of the approximately 1900 mortgages made in 2014 only 25 went to Black applicants. The banks' executives denied bias, and the settlement came with adjustments to the banks' business practices. This followed other successful efforts by the federal, state and city officials in 2014 to expand lending programs directed at minorities, and in some cases to force banks to pay penalties for patterns of redlining in Providence, R.I.; St. Louis, Mo.; Milwaukee, WI.; Buffalo and Rochester, N.Y. The Justice Dept also has more active redlining investigations underway, and officials have stated to reporters that "redlining is not a thing of the past". It has evolved into a more politically correct version, where bankers do not talk about denying loans to Black people openly. The justice department officials noted that some banks have quietly institutionalized bias in their operations. They have moved their operations out of minority communities entirely, while others have moved in to fill the void and compete for clients. Such management decisions are not the stated intent, it is left unspoken so that even the bank's other customers are unaware that it is occurring. The effect on minority communities can be profound as home ownership, a prime source of neighborhood stability and economic mobility can affect its vulnerability to blight and disrepair. In the 1960s and 1970s laws were passed banning the practice; its return is far less overt, and while the vast majority of banks operate legally, the practice appears to be more widespread as the investigation revealed a vast disparity in loans approved for Black people vs whites in similar situations.

**CLAIM: It’s illegal for employers to discriminate based on race.**

● Employment discrimination law in the United States derives from the common law. Also employment discrimination or harassment in the private sector is not unconstitutional because Federal and most State Constitutions do not expressly give their respective government the power to enact civil rights laws that apply to the private sector.

● Disparate treatment can be justified under CRA (Civil Rights Act) 1964 §2000e-2(e) if an employer shows selecting someone reflects by "religion, sex, or national origin is a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ) reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise.” Although race isn’t included, [the First Amendment will override Title VII in artistic works where the race of the employee is integral to the story or artistic purpose](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.jstor.org/stable/20439087).

● John Hendrickson, who spent 36 years as an EEOC attorney in Chicago before retiring in 2017, said too many cases are falling through the cracks. “Many of [the cases] weren’t professionally investigated.” Each year, the EEOC and its state and local partner agencies close more than 100,000 cases, but workers receive some form of assistance, such as money or a change in work conditions, only 18% of the time. Employees seeking help are even less likely to get it now than when Law went to the agency. In fact, no group of workers alleging discrimination, age, gender, disability, or otherwise, fares well. Race claims, however, are among the most commonly filed and have the lowest rate of success, with just 15% receiving some form of relief, often compensation.

**CLAIM: The welfare state made black people unemployed.**

● The link between welfare and joblessness is groundless and blinds us to what actually happened, leading to a distorted and dehumanizing understanding of both racism and poverty in the US. For unemployment rates to reach the massive rates they did (around 40-50% for the lowest-skilled Black working-age men from 1980-2000, compared to 20-25% among the same demographic from 1940-1960,) there is almost always a problem with the number of jobs available, not simply how many people want to work. So what would decrease the number of jobs available? First, there was a large wave of Black migration from the rural south to the urban north and west—as well as the urban south—in the 1940s and 50s, and the cities from the urban north were never able to provide enough jobs for all of these folks (who were seeking reprieve from the brutality and economic exploitation of the Jim Crow south). Racism drove them to these cities, where they were segregated into neighborhoods of other poor Black folks. Even though there weren’t enough jobs to go around, the manufacturing boom gave enough employment to improve the lot of many fleeing the south, reducing poverty during the '60s. Then, deindustrialization. The economy began to transition from an industrial and manufacturing economy—where most of the Black folks in these cities worked—to a deindustrialized, service-based economy in the ‘60s, ‘70s, and ‘80s. Capital (and the affluent, disproportionately white population, as well as the small Black middle class) moved out of cities and into suburbs, and the employment system Black folks had relied upon and which had already strained under the number of jobseekers finally collapsed. The welfare state policies of the War on Poverty were not useless, but they did not come anywhere close to the scope of the problems caused by these other structural factors. The knock-on effects of this concentration and subsequent deindustrialization were the rise in crime and decline in marriage that people often erroneously pin on welfare state programs. If a huge proportion of working-age men in your community cannot find any work, you can expect that many of them might seek out less legitimate ways of earning money through crime, and this would cyclically break down social networks of care and trust. The loss of tax dollars from the affluent residents of cities who had moved to the suburbs meant that services and infrastructure that were most necessary were crippled. You might expect that women would struggle to find men they were willing to marry if jobs were scarce. It certainly did not help that means-tested benefits would often drop off sharply if you were married, but this is not an inevitable feature of the welfare state. It’s the result of a badly designed policy. Universal benefits—say, a child allowance—that do not change if you get married would not have this disincentive effect. Pointing to the moment when the War on Poverty programs started and then pointing at the rise of unemployment and crime in the latter half of the 20th century is exactly the problem with correlation not being the same as causation and it’s a post hoc fallacy too. The problem is that the story basically ignores any structural factor other than welfare—and quite a number of things happened in the lead-up to the dramatic rise of unemployment and crime that you link to the welfare state. Popular videos on the internet again and again show the problem of correlation: there’s no time spent establishing that the welfare state was the primary cause, you’re just simply asserting it to be so. International comparisons also cast doubt on this story. If welfare disincentivizes work, you would expect that countries that spend a lot on welfare also have lower rates of work. But this is not at all what we find: employment rates and workforce participation rates are consistently high in countries like the Nordics where welfare spending is also much higher than in the US. We’ve gotten it wrong and blamed poor and Black people for social problems that would not exist without massive structural factors working against them. If we want to know how to help the least of these, we must first know why things are the way they are. In the case of this phenomenon, racism and deindustrialization—not the growth of America’s modest welfare state—were the driving forces.

○ “*Our primary analysis uses aggregate county turnout data from 2012 to 2016 and finds that the racial gap in turnout between more diverse and less diverse counties grew more in states enacting new strict photo ID laws than it did elsewhere – **even after controlling for other factors that could impact turnout. Strict voter ID laws appear to discriminate**.*”

# **Affirmative Action**
# **Affirmative action is about accounting for the inequality experienced in school systems. Despite studies showing that students benefit from having teachers who look like them, the overwhelming majority of teachers are white, even in areas with a high percentage of racial minorities and black people aren’t treated well in the school system either. Many children enter the public school system without knowing English and somehow manage to make enough progress to graduate high school with high GPAs. Not to mention the differences between ethnicities that have low levels of parent involvement in education due to systemic racism. Affirmative action isn't about skin color, it's about accounting for struggles overcome that other students haven't dealt with. Overlooking these factors would not only be unfair to minorities, but it would mean that colleges wouldn't always get the best students.**
**CLAIM: Affirmative Action is reverse discrimination against white people**

● Evidence demonstrates that discrimination against white men is rare. For example, of the 91,000 employment discrimination cases before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, approximately 3% percent are discrimination cases against white men. Further, a study conducted by Rutgers University and commissioned by the U.S. Department of Labor (1995) found that discrimination against white men is not a significant problem in employment and that a "high proportion" of claims brought by white men are "without merit." Affirmative action provides the employer with the largest pool of qualified applicants from which to choose.

● According to the Commerce Department, there are fewer than 2 million unemployed Black civilians and more than 100 million employed White civilians (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1994). Thus, even if every unemployed Black worker were to displace a White worker, less than 2% of Whites would be affected. Furthermore, affirmative action pertains only to job-qualified applicants, so the actual percentage of affected Whites would be a fraction of 1%. The main sources of job loss among White workers have to do with factory relocations and labor contracting outside the United States, computerization and automation, and corporate downsizing.

■ “A 1995 report by the Department of Labor found that 6 million women overall had advances at their job that would not have been possible without affirmative action. The percentage of women physicians tripled between 1970 and 2002, from 7.6 percent to 25.2 percent, and in 2009 women were receiving a majority of bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees, according to the American Association of University Women. To be clear, these numbers include women of all races; however, breaking down affirmative action beneficiaries by race and gender seems to be rare in reported data.”

■ “Among white admits, over 43% are ALDC. Among admits who are African American, Asian American, and Hispanic, the share is less than 16% each. Our model of admissions shows that roughly three quarters of white ALDC admits would have been rejected if they had been treated as white non-ALDCs.”

**CLAIM: Affirmative action is discrimination against Asians.**

● [A 2016 study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0895904815616484) found that eliminating affirmative action would not increase the number of Asian Americans in elite colleges. When you completely eliminate Black and Latinx applicants from the Harvard admissions pool, the admissions rate for all remaining Asian American and white students only increases by 1%. This means that rejected Asian American and white applicants were unlikely to be admitted even with the omission of race.

● Affirmative action opponents don’t have the interests of Asians in mind. Rather, Asian students are being weaponized against marginalized college hopefuls. They intentionally invoke the model minority myth by portraying all Asians as highly successful individuals unfairly hurt by affirmative action. This advances the false narrative that Asian American students are a monolith, and completely ignores Asians who do not fit the model minority stereotype. Only about half of Asian Americans hold a bachelor’s degree or higher.

○ There are also large discrepancies between various subgroups in the Asian American community. For example, only 27% of Vietnamese Americans and only 17% of Hmong and Cambodian Americans hold a bachelor’s degree or higher.

● Furthermore, Southeast Asian Americans benefit from affirmative action policies. While Blum claims he is protecting the interests of Asian Americans, his lawsuit ignores the fact that an overwhelming majority — 70% —  of Asian Americans agree with affirmative action. It’s no surprise, then, that more than 135 Asian American organizations banded together to support affirmative action.

**CLAIM: Under affirmative action, minorities receive preferences.**

● Most supporters of affirmative action oppose this type of preferential selection. Affirmative action does not require preferences, nor do women and minorities assume that they will be given preference. Race, gender, and national origin are factors that can be considered when hiring or accepting qualified applicants. Hiring qualified women and minorities is similar to the preferences given to veterans in hiring and to children of alumni in college admissions. There are also other preferences used in selecting qualified candidates. For example, when private colleges and universities value geographic diversity on their campuses, an out-of-state student may be admitted before an in-state student. Some colleges and universities consider athletic abilities and/or evidence of leadership skills in addition to academic qualifications. Only 3% of institutions indicate race has “considerable influence” in admissions decisions. Instead, there were 14 other criteria, such as test scores, grades, writing samples, and extracurricular activities, which were more likely to be considered than race. Only 11% of institutions reported that race had moderate influence, while 19% reported limited influence on admissions decisions. Overall, only one-third of four-year public and private institutions consider race in any way, minor or major, when evaluating applicants.

**CLAIM: Affirmative Action is about quotas.**

● 1. Under existing law, quotas are illegal. 2. Federal contractors are required to establish goals and timetables, and to make a good- faith effort to meet them. Race, national origin, and gender are among several factors to be considered, but relevant and valid job or educational qualifications are not to be compromised. Further, the Supreme Court has made clear that affirmative action or programs that claim to be affirmative action are illegal if: (1) an unqualified person receives benefits over a qualified one; (2) numerical goals are so strict that the plan lacks reasonable flexibility; (3) the numerical goals bear no relationship to the available pool of qualified candidates and could therefore become quotas; (4) the plan is not fixed in length; or (5) innocent bystanders are impermissibly harmed.

**CLAIM: Unqualified people get accepted under affirmative action.**

● Only affirmative action plans that do not compromise valid job or educational qualifications are lawful. Plans must be flexible, realistic, reviewable, and fair. The Supreme Court has found that there are at least two permissible bases for voluntary affirmative action by employers under Title VII: (1) to remedy a clear and convincing history of past discrimination by the employer or union, and (2) to cure a manifest imbalance in the employer's work force. Thus, affirmative action programs are intended to hire the most qualified individuals, while at the same time achieving equality of opportunity for all.

**CLAIM: It should be based on income, not race.**

● Income-based approaches don’t yield equal results when it comes to increasing the number of Black and Brown faces on campus. The suggestion to replace race with income dangerously and falsely signals that race is a negligible factor that has very little impact on students’ educational and broader social experiences. Additionally, income-based approaches won’t account for racial differences for students from similar socioeconomic backgrounds. Black, Latino, and White students from similar income backgrounds have considerable differences in their enrollment at highly selective postsecondary institutions. And the racial differences become more profound as family income increases. Income-based affirmative action would ignore these differences by race, and would place another hurdle in the path of many Black and Latino Students. In the fourth income quartile, Black students trail White students by 8 percentage points, and by the fifth income quartile, the gap grows to 26 percentage points. The enrollment gap clearly shows that income is not enough: Colleges and universities need to continue using race as a factor in admissions.

**CLAIM: Affirmative Action doesn’t work.**

● According to a recent report from the Labor Department, affirmative action has helped 5 million minority members and 6 million White and minority women move up in the workforce.

● A study sponsored by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs showed that between 1974 and 1980 federal contractors (who were required to adopt affirmative action goals) added Black and female officials and managers at twice the rate of non contractors.

● There have also been a number of well-publicized cases in which large companies (e.g., AT&T, IBM, Sears Roebuck) increased minority employment as a result of adopting affirmative action policies.
# **Black Culture**
**Culture is still an institution/system. Implicit learning of culture is largely subliminal but people pick up on certain cultural cues throughout the course of their life and learn certain behaviors based on how those around them act. This comes as a direct or indirect result of their material conditions; in fact in order to change the “culture”, the environment would have to change completely.**

○ Finds that for enslaved blacks, it took 2 generations for them to catch up with free blacks. That’s a lot of time!

■ When comparing blacks overall to whites, they found that blacks have been converging with the path of whites over time **but they still haven’t fully caught up**. That’s a lot of time post Jim Crow, certainly more than 2 generations

○ “*This paper has demonstrated that on certain basic outcome measures, namely literacy, schooling, and occupation, **the descendants of slaves "caught-up" to the descendants of free blacks within two generations**. This statement is particularly true when we identify the effects of slave status by comparing descendants of free blacks and slaves who reside outside of the South. **If we instead measure the progress of free blacks and slaves (and their descendants) relative to whites born in the same regions, then we find partial but not complete convergence**.*”

○ White families **are twice as likely to receive an inheritance as black families, and that inheritance is nearly three times as much.** Even among black families who inherit wealth, **the racial wage gap is much larger, compared to white families who inherit wealth.** For families with an inheritance, **median white wealth is 7.5 times larger than for black families.** Comparatively, **white families have 5.4 times more wealth than black families without an inheritance.** The importance of inheritances to the wealth position of white families is staggering. At the median, an inheritance increases wealth by **more than $100,000 for white families and only $4,000 for black families.**

○ Average income for both White and Black families has increased since the 1970s. However, average income for White families in their 30s has increased from $50,000 to $60,000 from 1975 to 2005, compared to an increase from $32,000 to $35,000 for Black families of the same age over the same period.

○ In addition to receiving a lower average income, its growth is also less for Black families (10% growth) than their White counterparts (19% growth).

○ Two of three White children born into families in the middle quintile have achieved a higher family income than their parents. Conversely, only one of three Black children born into families in the middle quintile has achieved a higher family income than their parents.

○ On average, Black children whose parents were in the bottom or second quintile do exceed their parents' income, but those whose parents were in the middle or fourth quintile actually have a lower income than their parents. This is a very large difference compared to Whites, who experience intergenerational income growth in every quintile except the highest.

○ This shows that in addition to lower wages with less growth over time, it is less likely for Black families to experience upward economic mobility than it is for Whites.

## **Common Black Culture Myths:**
**CLAIM: It has nothing to do with race, and everything to do with culture.**

● First of all, this doesn’t make sense because it’s something you can’t quantify or empirically test for. Second of all,** this argument also overlooks positive trends in critical areas such as education, crime and teen pregnancy (pregnancy and birth rates among black teenagers are down 40 percent since 1990). Third of all, this exaggerates the cultural differences between white and black Americans. We forget that white and black youths listen to rap today and that neither white people nor black people like being poor. The record is clear: when opportunities are available to black Americans, they take them. When opportunities are scarce, they fall behind, and culture has very little to do with it. It’s purely speculative, surmisable, conjectural, suppositious, unsubstantiated, and ostensibly abstract in nature based on stereotypes & anecdotes which are just based off of ambient animus. This is not consistent with the scientific method.

○ Let’s take a step back here and think about how statistics like these have been used over the past century. The first time these kind of figures became relevant was after the 1890 census, when Frederick Hoffman, an accountant in New Jersey, calculated that blacks accounted for 30% of the nation’s prisoners but only 12% of the population. The conclusion that Hoffman drew – and that many others have drawn, even into the present – is that African Americans have an innate predisposition toward criminality, whether cultural or genetic.

○ W.E.B. DuBois countered this assertion with a study of black crime in Philadelphia, which he argued was the result of sociological factors – particularly urbanization and industrialization – rather than some innate character trait of black people. Yet the assumption stuck, and even to the present a belief that criminality represents proof and cause of black inferiority remains very strong in American society. (Khalil Gibran Muhammad discusses this at length in his book, The Condemnation of Blackness: Race, Crime, and the Making of Modern Urban America; here’s an interview in which he discusses the 1890 census.)

○ Yet the higher percentage rate of imprisonment among blacks in 1890 was to a large degree the result of a conscious effort by Southern whites to reduce blacks to a captive, servile labor force through the use of the criminal law. Remember that even though slavery was abolished after the Civil War, most white Southerners did not view its abolition as legitimate and did everything in their power to install a racial order in which blacks would once again be a servile laboring class without political rights – essentially slaves in all but name. This was accomplished in part through the Black Codes, which criminalized African-American behavior that was deemed contrary to this order. For example, many states passed vagrancy laws, which required blacks to sign work contracts for fixed periods – if they were found without these contracts, they would be arrested for vagrancy.

○ Other states and municipalities passed what some call “pig laws”, turning forms of petty theft from misdemeanors into felonies, allowing for heavy terms of imprisonment for blacks who committed offenses as trivial as stealing a pig – hence the name. (And in many cases, it was not even theft; blacks were engaged in work disputes with landlords and employee, and claimed property they believed was rightfully their own – only to be arrested for the same.)

○ Law officers were granted a large degree of discretion in enforcing these statutes, and the police were virtually without exception whites with a strong racial bias. What’s more, black prisoners were put to work through the convict lease system, which gave landlords, corporations, states, and municipalities access to very cheap labor, and which played a central role in the industrialization and urbanization of the South at the turn of the last century; about 73% of Alabama's entire annual state revenue came from convict leasing in 1893. So the entire criminal justice system had a vested interest in securing higher rates of arrest, conviction and imprisonment among blacks, both as a source of profit and a means of reinforcing white supremacy. The heavy involvement of blacks in the criminal justice system, in turn, fostered racial ideas about their inferiority. As Muhammad puts it: “Defining black criminality through racial and cultural markers of inferiority was at the heart of post-emancipation race relations. Black Codes, Pig Laws, convict leasing, chain gangs, and lynching were direct consequences of inventing new ways of thinking about blacks and using criminal laws, criminal justice practices, and violence to target them—all tracked by statistics, reifying racist presumptions that blacks were an exceptional and dangerous criminal population.” (p. 284)

○ So starting this discussion in the 1950s is misleading, in that it fails to account for why this association of African Americans and criminality exists - an association that has its origins in Reconstruction and the beginnings of Jim Crow segregation.

**CLAIM: Black culture doesn’t value education so that’s why it sucks in the black community/they’re not graduating high school and dropping out.**

● This is blatantly not true, African Americans value education; however, there are other factors that make the education they experience poor

● Which Black people specifically would they be referring to who aren’t graduating? Because Black people are graduating in fact the black and white graduation rate is similar and only differ by 3 percentage points (85.8% vs 88.8%). Not to mention how 88% of black people have their high school diploma.

● [**Study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/tables/ACGR_RE_and_characteristics_2017-18.asp) **used to say black people are graduating at a lower rate (79.0)**

○ Data wasn’t even collected from states like Puerto Rico. Different states implement different requirements for the ACGR. This means there are substantial differences for rates and how they’re calculated in different states in respect especially for black people. The ACGR is just the rate of kids who graduate ON TIME. Not total graduations.

**CLAIM: Just don’t break the law**

● This would make sense if there was actually differential offending, which there’s little evidence that there is. Instead there is differential police presence, patrolling, and profiling, combined with discrimination in the courts and correctional systems which leads to more Black people being arrested, convicted, and incarcerated more frequently which is not necessarily indicative of differential offending. Indeed, It is correct that Black people are disproportionately convicted of crimes. However, the main problem lies in the idea that convictions are one-to-one equivalents of perpetrated crimes, especially in the context of racist police and legal systems. 

**CLAIM: Blacks have a gang culture/rap that makes them commit crimes**

● Multiple studies have found that a variety of factors influence gang membership, and those factors usually are closely related to poverty, bad schooling environments, and bad upbringings - certainly not exclusively cultural, but in a lot of ways reflective of the amount of poverty and hardship a community is going through

● [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190740914001741](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190740914001741) looks at what conditions correlate with gang participation

○ Poor neighborhood quality has a higher likelihood of predicting gang involvement than negative peer groups. (AOR: 1.43 vs. 1.08).

● [https://web.stanford.edu/class/e297c/poverty_prejudice/ganginterv/gangsproblems.htm](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://web.stanford.edu/class/e297c/poverty_prejudice/ganginterv/gangsproblems.htm) goes over a number of common reasons why people join gangs

● Although Rap emerged in the 1970s gangster rap emerged around 1985. Early rappers like Sugar Hill Gang and Run-D.M.C mixed rock music and funk and told stories about their lives. But if you look at the crime rates for these periods, crime increased in the 60s and 70s whereas it plateaued in the 80s and it’s fallen consistently despite the fact rap has stayed just as “violent” as it was in the 80s and 90s. Various criminologists have done studies into this and found that it is bad criminology and sociology to conclude rap music causes violence. They even go as far to say it’s racist since it is attributing something bad to black culture that doesn’t cause the bad thing. Other studies have found that media consumption has no effect on children’s violence.

**CLAIM: Whites have no responsibility in the development of black culture, blacks have been on their own for a while now so any burden on them is their fault, not that of whites.**

● The conditions in which black culture started out happened to be in a situation in which they were constantly beaten down and discriminated against and this continued over the course of centuries - through slavery, jim crow, etc. they haven’t had a lot of time to work outside of these overt forms of discrimination, either - plenty of black boomers were direct victims of jim crow. Thus, white-instigated racism still has had a huge influence on black culture today. If we take this argument to be the case — that Black culture produces behaviors that further their disadvantaged economic position — this is not something created by any individual Black American, but rather inherited as a set of cultural circumstances. Can they be blamed for acting in a way that gains them what anyone is looking for — social acceptance and getting their needs met — within that cultural setting? A person of average willpower would, in aggregate, behave the same given that cultural environment as the average Black person. To say otherwise is, ultimately, to claim that Black people as a whole have behaved more poorly given their inherited culture than other people would. To make such a move would be to assign an essential racial inferiority to Black people. 

**CLAIM: The welfare state is to blame for black culture.**

● Why would it be that Black culture would adapt to the material conditions of the welfare state but not the material conditions of, say, housing discrimination and deindustrialization leading to unemployment? The rational conclusion is that people who make this argument want to downplay the history of material deprivation and inequality that led to the behaviors they want to condemn and magnify the role welfare had to play in those behaviors because they have an ideological predisposition to oppose welfare.

**CLAIM: Black people are just bad at spending their money.**

● White families actually [spend more and save less](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10161/13809/2332649216647748.pdf?sequence=1) than black families with the same income. Yet white families have way more wealth than black families with the same income. Low-income black households spend $5,223 on average compared with $7,058 for low-income white households, middle-income black households spend $9,113 (vs. $11,106 for white households), and top-income black households spend $16,527 (vs. $21,075 for white households).

○ Even after accounting for factors such as family structure, income, occupation, and geography, as well as wealth and homeownership, white households at all income levels continued to spend more than comparable black households, with low-income white households spending $1,200 more per quarter than low-income black households and high-income white households spending $1,400 more than their black counterparts.

● So, the average white household spends 1.3 times more than the average black household of the same income group.

○ [The same researchers](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6641572/pdf/nihms-1041011.pdf) also looked at specific categories of spending, finding that white households spend about twice as much as black households on entertainment among all income groups and that white households, especially those with low incomes, spend more than black households on cars. The researchers note that “for clothing, jewelry, personal care, entertainment, eating out, and other non-essential spending, our findings show that black consumers in fact spend the same or much less than whites, at all income levels.” The only category in which black households were found to consistently spend more was for utilities, including payments for electricity, heating fuel, water, sewer and telephone service; this may be due to the common utility company practice of risk-based pricing, which requires a deposit or other form of additional payment from customers with low credit scores, without stable employment, or with criminal records. While technically color-blind, risk-based pricing can have a disproportionate impact on black consumers, causing them to be charged more than white households for the same service.

**CLAIM: Asian people were oppressed and interned during ww2 and discriminated against afterwards, so why aren't they as bad off as blacks are?**

● These days, the majority of America's Asian population is only one or two generations removed from legal immigrants who came to America for merit-based citizenship. That automatically puts them, on average, at an advantage - even over poor white Americans.

● Immigration from Asia was historically suppressed by legislation like the Chinese Exclusion Act (1882) and the Immigration Act of 1924. It wasn’t until the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1965 that immigration from Asia boomed. [In just over 50 years, the population of Asian Americans went from 980,000 in 1960 to 20.4 million in 2015](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/09/08/key-facts-about-asian-americans/) - 1960 was *after* the WWII concentration camps. Today 72% of the adult US Asian population was born outside of the US.

○ Being a heavily-immigrant population, Asian Americans on average have a better education and background compared both to the average white or native-born American and compared to the general populations in their country of origin, due to selection processes by America’s immigration system.

**CLAIM: Jewish people were oppressed so why aren’t they as bad off as blacks are?**

● This is not comparable because:

○ Jewish people received Israel.

○ Germany paid $33 billion in reparations.

○ Holocaust survivors get $300 annually.

○ The U.S gave $12 million in reparations to holocaust survivors in 2015.

○ The U.S agreed to give Israel over $38 billion in 2016 over a 10-year period.

**CLAIM: Black immigrants are successful in America and they’re black, why aren’t they as bad off as blacks are?**

● The syllogistic format of this argument is as follows:

○ P1: You can't distinguish black immigrants and African Americans just by looking at them.

○ P2: P1 implies that the level of systemic racism endured by black immigrants and African Americans is essentially the same.

○ P3: Black immigrants earn more, are employed more, and generally do better than African Americans in society.

○ C: The effects of systemic racism are minimal.

● Multiple hypotheses have been formulated for P3 including Cultural Distinction Theory, Black Immigrants Privilege, Selectivity Theory, Queuing Theory, Lateral Mobility Hypothesis, etc. Specifically, the Cultural Hypothesis was advanced in 1978 through a paper by Thomas Sowell, [*Three Black Histories](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/archive.wilsonquarterly.com/essays/ethnicity-three-black-histories)*.* He basically posits that the differences we see in the data between African Americans and Black immigrants are to be attributed to a diversity in customs and cultures. However, the Selectivity Hypothesis instead conjectures that the observed differences between Black Immigrants and African Americans are due to immigrant selectivity. Immigrant selectivity is the stylized fact that immigrants aren’t selected at random from their population of origin. Instead they exhibit different traits with respect to individuals who do not immigrate. This would mean that Black immigrants have more “hard” and “soft” skills than those they join at the new destinations and those left behind in their country of origin, see [Model 1995](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://academic.oup.com/socpro/article-abstract/42/4/535/1684827?redirectedFrom=PDF). Another hypothesis is the Lateral Mobility Hypothesis which conjectures that immigrants do better if they had socioeconomic conditions that were higher than average in their countries of origin. The underlying assumption is that socioeconomic status replicates itself, over and above, group differences in skills, see [Darity 2003](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1536-7150.00070). Ultimately, the hypothesis that gets the most traction in the literature is the Immigrant Selectivity one ([Hamilton 2014](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4767170/pdf/nihms-598661.pdf); [Ifatunji 2017](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/socf.12347)). Additionally, this argument runs into a problem. In fact we see through reports that these two groups diverge through time and can be dated back to 1925, see [Domingo 1925](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.unz.com/pbuchanan/reining-in-the-rogue-royal-of-arabia/). In addition, the data used for Thomas Sowell’s Cultural Hypothesis is in 1970. Should we accept this argument, would that mean that systemic racism was minimal in 1970? 5 years after Jim Crow was outlawed? What about in 1925? Even if we granted that African Americans and Black Immigrants differ in culture, which is the minimal position held in the scientific community, why would that imply that systemic racism is minimal? Assuming systemic racism exists, both Black immigrants and African Americans could earn a lot more if systemic racism were not holding them both down. Ultimately the premises don’t support the conclusion so it’s a non sequitur.

○ **Nigerians**

● You probably mean Sub-Saharan given how highly-developed North Africa is, and how successful immigrants from North Africa are in the U.S. Nigeria, Ghana, etc. all have a common thread: they're ex-British colonies, so immigrants can often move to another Anglophone country (such as the United States) without having to learn English. Most successful African immigrants come from Anglophone countries; this also applies to immigrants from Sierra Leone, Kenya, Tanzania, etc. You'll notice that immigrants from Sub-Saharan countries that are Francophone (Senegal, Mali, DR Congo), Lusophone (Angola, Mozambique), Arabophone (Somali, Djibouti), or otherwise not Anglo (Ethiopia was never colonized although it was briefly occupied by Fascist Italy from 1937-41, which wasn't long enough to bring the country into the Italosphere), also struggle when they come to America. A lot of it is a language barrier. When it comes to Nigerians though there’s a variety of reasons they may be successful.

● “To understand why the Nigerian American population became so successful, it’s important to understand how our Nigerian American population developed. This requires a basic understanding of the history of U.S. Immigration law, something most of us never learned in school. The current Nigerian American population is composed of first wave (1970s and ’80s) immigrants, second wave (1990s and after) immigrants, and their children. Before 1965, American immigration policy was explicitly designed to keep America white. This is our history, not my opinion. Before that, we had an immigration quota system called the national origins formula. This formula limited the number of people who were allowed to immigrate to the U.S. from countries outside of Western Europe to 165,000 people. It also set country-by-country quotas based on the U.S. population at the time. This meant that Western Europeans, who already made up the majority of the country, would continue to be the majority of immigrants. Eastern Europeans were also allowed to immigrate, albeit in limited numbers. Asians and South Asians were banned from becoming citizens through the Asian Exclusion Act. All of Africa, with the exception of Egypt, was allowed 1100 immigrants a year. Immigrants were subject to literacy tests, which privileged English speakers. They were also subject to immigration taxes and allowed to be turned away based on the ‘discretion’ of an immigration officer, who were almost exclusively white men. According to the U.S. State Department’s Office of the Historian, “the most basic purpose of the 1924 Immigration Act was to preserve the ideal of U.S. homogeneity.” These quotas remained in place until 1965 when Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. This act placed limits on immigration from Western European countries for the first time in our nation's history. Under the new immigration act, preference was given to relatives of American citizens and permanent residents and “Members of the professions,” defined as people “holding advanced degrees or their equivalent and aliens who because of their exceptional ability in the sciences, arts, or business will substantially benefit the national economy, cultural, or educational interests or welfare of the United States.” This was a controversial bill that a lot of white senators and representatives were against. Senator Spessard Holland of Florida said: “What I object to is imposing no limitation insofar as areas of the earth are concerned, but saying that we are throwing the doors open and equally inviting people from the Orient, from the islands of the Pacific, from the subcontinent of Asia, from the Near East, from all of Africa, all of Europe, and all of the Western Hemisphere on exactly the same basis. I am inviting attention to the fact that this is a complete and radical departure from what has always heretofore been regarded as sound principles of immigration.” - Congressional Record, Sept. 22, 1965, p. 24779. Myra C. Hacker, Vice President of the nativist group New Jersey Coalition of Patriotic Societies said this at a Senate subcommittee hearing: “In light of our 5% unemployment rate, our worries over the so called population explosion, and our menacingly mounting welfare costs, are we prepared to embrace so great a horde of the world’s unfortunates? At the very least, the hidden mathematics of the bill should be made clear to the public so that they may tell their Congressmen how they feel about providing jobs, schools, homes, security against want, citizen education, and a brotherly welcome … for an indeterminately enormous number of aliens from underprivileged lands.” Hacker and others like her saw the long-term potential of an emerging ‘chain migration’ pattern. By giving preference to relatives of citizens and permanent residents, entire families from ‘undesirable’ countries could sponsor each other into citizenship, which is exactly what happened. The global politics of the 1960s was one of revolution. Seven years after Great Britain decolonized Nigeria, the country waged a civil war. After the war, the newly reunified Nigerian government profited from a favorable trade partnership with America. Nigeria was one of the few countries willing to sell oil to the U.S. during the 1973 oil embargo crisis. During this time, the Nigerian government also provided scholarships for Nigerian students who wanted to study abroad in America. These scholarships covered the cost of education at state schools like the University of Nebraska or Ivy’s like Harvard and Yale. If you had a choice between free beef jerky and free filet mignon, what would you pick? Exactly. Many Nigerian Americans got an all-expense-paid trip to an Ivy League University. These Nigerians knew that going to graduate school and becoming a doctor, lawyer or engineer was the best way for them to become American citizens. After becoming citizens, they could sponsor relatives for citizenship, relatives who were able to enter the United States as legacies at top universities. First-generation Nigerian Americans who immigrated in the ’70s and '80s had the advantage of free education. First-generation Nigerian Americans who came in the ’90s had a different type of advantage. The Immigration Act of 1990 introduced EB-1, EB-2, EB-3 and Diversity Immigrant Visas. In a nutshell, EB 1–3 Visas made it easier for immigrants who were doctors and lawyers to become citizens or permanent residents than immigrants who were, say, janitors or freelance musicians. Diversity Immigrant Visas, also known as the green card lottery, were for immigrants who didn’t qualify for EB 1, 2 or 3 visas. Nigerian Americans didn’t ‘rise to the top’ so much as they were cherry-picked from the top. I’m not discounting the hard work it takes to become a doctor or lawyer, nor am I saying that Nigerian Americans don’t deserve their success. I’m saying there’s a bigger picture that we often ignore in favor of the ‘model minority’ stereotype, and continuing to ignore that picture harms and demeans us all. If you took the entire NBA bubble and moved it to Mongolia, it might seem to Mongolians that most first-generation American Mongolians were either basketball players, sports agents or coaches. If you took the top one percent of income earners in America and moved them to Chile, it might look to Chileans like all Americans are rich. Cherry-picking creates a false sample size, and this skewed sample size is the heart and soul of the model minority myth. In Nigeria, 30% of the population is illiterate, in comparison to 21% of the U.S. population. Ten million Nigerian children who should be in school are not. Young Nigerians often struggle to afford a college education, just like their American peers. Nigeria spends roughly 7% of its national budget on education, compared to America’s 3%. Another thing is Oil money, huge population (nearing 200 million) with a large Anglophone contingent = more highly-educated, English speaking immigrants than from other African countries. It's economies of scale. Nigerian immigrants tend to be the absolute best of the best, coming from families that made their money in oil (or corruption, or sometimes both). Anglophone population and political stability. Ghana and Botswana are some of the most politically stable countries in Africa, which builds a robust, well-educated bourgeoisie; this allows more immigrants from those countries to come to the United States out of their own accord and not because they're fleeing a dictator. Immigration from Ethiopia to the United States only really began in the 1980s with political refugees fleeing the Derg, and refugee families fleeing famine and starvation (usually after spending months to years in the squalor of a UN camp in neighboring Kenya). Famine persisted into the 90s, 2000s and 2010s, and political-based migration continued due to the power vacuum after the fall of the Derg in 1991. Somalis fled the regime of Siad Barre in the 1980s, and the forthcoming years weren't pleasant for the country: the 1990s power vacuum/warlord rule, the repression of the ICU in the mid 2000s, the second power vacuum from the mid 2000s to today, etc. For Ethiopians and Somalis, and this goes for Malians, Cameroonians, Congolese, etc., they didn't choose to come here. Wealthy Nigerians and immigrants from the large middle-class of Ghana could come to America to study by choice, but for the rest of Africa, they're fleeing war, political repression, famine/drought, they don't have a choice in the matter, they would have been happy to go to any safe refuge (Canada, Australia, Switzerland, Norway) and not languish in a UN refugee camp in Kenya or Sudan. Since migrants from those countries aren't motivated, wealthy, and well-educated like Nigerians, they take whatever jobs they can get: owning garages/convenience stores/gas stations (this is very common in Seattle), housekeeping/hotel work, chauffeurs, construction/general labor, etc. The high school dropout rate is high and the college degree rate is low. Out of all African immigrants, Somalis rank first in the former and last in the latter. And I read a report, I don't remember where, it might have been the Rockefeller Institute, that showed Ethiopian immigrants ranked near the bottom for the proportion of diaspora members in professional white-collar/manager work (only below Salvadorese, Mexicans, and Haitians) whereas nearly half of Nigerian immigrants were in professional occupations. At the end of the day, the success of Nigerian Americans and other so-called ‘model minorities’ cannot explain away Black Americans' lack of success. It cannot erase the fact that white Americans have received explicit advantages in this country from 1776 until 1968, and continue to benefit from implicit advantages of whiteness to this day. The only thing asking “but what about Nigerians?” does derail real conversations about American anti-Blackness and the enduring legacy of white supremacy.”

**CLAIM: It’s all about personal responsibility and choices.**

● Personal responsibility and choice affect a lot of things but it shouldn’t vary along racial lines. The variance along racial lines can either be because of two things: environment or genetics. Assuming one isn’t a racist, then we’d have to acknowledge that people’s environment leads them to make bad decisions.

**CLAIM: The black single motherhood rate jumped from 20% to 70%.**

● “Single motherhood” can be defined as parents who live together but never married/children just born out of wedlock, or widows, or divorced. In reality black fathers are more likely to be in their children’s lives than not. [https://medium.com/national-center-for-institutional-diversity/evolving-the-single-black-mother-narrative-eaee03cce251](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://medium.com/national-center-for-institutional-diversity/evolving-the-single-black-mother-narrative-eaee03cce251)

○ Fatherlessness among the black population is only about 42% anyway, the 70% number was literally pulled out of someone’s ass. 70% of black fathers were also more likely to participate in certain activities with their children such as bathing and clothing them, feeding them, reading to them, helping with homework, and overall doing more of a “very well” job in parenting compared to 43% white fathers. [https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr071.pdf](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr071.pdf)

■ **Small sample size.**

■ First of all, this was a random sample which means we can make statistical inferences based on the population by simply taking the population size of black fathers and multiplying it by the sample proportion of those involved. Based on this process we’d see that ~3 million is a reasonable estimate of black fathers who are involved with their children. Second of all, this was weighted survey data so it is representative and accurate. “All estimates for 2006–2010 in this report were weighted to reflect the approximately 62 million men aged 15–44 in the household population of the United States at the midpoint of interviewing, June 2008.”

○ A Boston University 2007 study  noted that black fathers who don’t reside in the home are more likely to sustain regular contact with their children than fathers of any other racial group. According to the US Census Bureau, single black fathers raising children on their own comprise some 353,000, or nearly 16%, of single-father households. From "[The Myth of the Missing Black Father](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Myth_of_the_Missing_Black_Father.html)" : An increasing number of quantitative and qualitative studies find that of men who become fathers through nonmarital births, black men are least likely (when compared to white and Hispanic fathers) to marry or cohabit with the mother (Mott 1994; Lerman and Sorensen 2000). But they were found to have the highest rates (estimates range from 20% to over 50%) of visitation or provision of some caretaking or in-kind support (more than formal child support). For instance, Carlson and McLanahan’s (2002) figures indicated that only 37 percent of black non marital fathers were cohabiting with the child (compared to 66% of white fathers and 59% of Hispanic), but of those who weren’t cohabiting, 44% of unmarried black fathers were visiting the child, compared to only 17% of white and 26% of Hispanic fathers.

○ **Great Society Act**

● The Great Society Act was not to blame for the rise in African American fatherlessness.

○ 1. Rates of fatherlessness for white people have always been lower than for black people, but fatherlessness among whites still rose between 1960 and 2012. 6% of white children lived in a single-mother household in 1960, a figure that rose to 18% in 2013. that’s a tripling, which was proportionately an even bigger percentage increase than what was observed for black children.

○ 2. Douglas J. Besharov, a public policy professor at the university of Maryland, said the official data on black marriage from the early-to mid-20th century is unreliable. it was not uncommon, he said, for black mothers to tell survey-takers that they were separated, when in fact they had never been married, he said. The data for white women is similarly misleading, since many young white women got married as teens and divorced a few years later -- a "shotgun wedding" pattern that doesn’t suggest long-term stability for children. This pattern would mean that the frequency of non-marital births among African Americans have been higher than what the early 1960s statistics officially indicated, and the white rate of non-marital births have been artificially low.

○ 3. The welfare rules of the 1960s may have imposed a "marriage penalty" on recipients. benefits that could be earned as a single person would disappear once a recipient got married. but such a pattern should have become evident well before the Great Society Act. Timothy M. Smeeding, director of the Institute for research on poverty at the university of wisconsin said, “‘welfare’ was part of the new deal in the 1930s,...it was designed for widows with kids who didn’t qualify for social security, but it soon became a single-parent program for divorcees and later unmarried mothers.”

○ 4. Just because rates of fatherlessness rose after Johnson and the great society act doesn’t mean they caused the increase. Lots of other factors were at play. besharov said the focus on johnson is off-base. he said that the broader social currents of 1960s "liberalization" - more permissive sexual mores, easier divorce laws and greater financial independence due to rising rates of female employment, for instance, did play a role in higher rates of single-motherhood for all races, but "if you define ‘the great society’ as the things johnson did, then there was very little impact" on single motherhood rates.

● Haskins and Sawhill overlook a lot in their path to arrive at these figures, and they admit that their study has serious methodological flaws. The first is that the data is not considering one's likelihood of poverty in general, but rather specifically focusing on the incidence rate of poverty in 2007. There is no attempt to develop causality, and no explanation for why there are more poor people who followed all three rules than poor people who did not. Beyond that, subsequent research and re-evaluation by Brookings found that the "three rules" break down when accounting for race. Even among black people who followed all three rules, only 59% defined as "middle income" or above, and 75% were at or below 500% of the poverty line (compared to 58% of whites). It's also difficult to determine the degree of choice involved in full-time employment, which was the most important of the "three rules" by far.

**CLAIM: Black people have a victim mentality.**

● First, this argument presumes that persons of color are too stupid to already know what it is they’re experiencing. Those who bemoan the so-called victim mindset appear to believe that no one would think about racism were it not for the constant presence of liberals and leftists raising the issue. Secondly, the argument supposes that black and brown folks are so weak-willed that if they really understood the obstacles in their way, they would crumble like pie crust. As such, the fact that prominent black conservatives like Shelby Steele or Walter Williams are among the most outspoken proponents of this argument–that discussing racism risks the inculcation of a permanent victim mentality–suggests how little they think of their own racial group. The truth is, folks of color (especially African Americans) are well aware of the negative stereotypes held about their racial group by an early age. Indeed, recent evidence indicates an awareness of these stereotypes by as soon as the third grade, and rarely later than the fifth: around the age of, say, eleven. This awareness–which is not due to liberals bringing it up, but rather, the result of black and brown folks living with the mistreatment that stems from the stereotypes and being exposed to them in media and elsewhere–has been found to dramatically impact academic performance. Even (and especially) among highly capable and motivated students of color, the fear of living down to a stereotype has been shown to generate such anxiety that it can suppress performance, relative to ability, thereby perpetuating the very performance gaps that feed the stereotypes about black intelligence in the first place. In other words, whether or not white racism is discussed, the knowledge of its existence is sufficient to negatively impact black and brown success. Talking about racism isn’t the problem: racism itself is.

# **Stereotype Accuracy**
For this topic, we will wrap it in a debunk of Lee Jussim. Lee Jussim’s work centers around a book, in which he finds that stereotypes are largely accurate. This is done by finding correlations between stereotypes and reality. However, this sort of analysis neglects many things. Some of those things are noted in this thread, which you should read:

● <https://archive.ph/BqQ7X> 

○ Thread shows why the data is often horribly wrong - **read the thread**

○ One of the things the thread does is showcase that not every stereotype is the same. Is the belief that red-heads have red hair the same as the belief that immigrants commit more crime? [Both are widely held beliefs, and yet one is wrong in the US - immigrants commit way less crime than natives.](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://items.ssrc.org/border-battles/the-myth-of-immigrant-criminality/) When Jussim thus draws his conclusion that “stereotypes are generally accurate”, and doesn’t include any questions like this, it’s telling. For instance, we know that stereotypes about the fiscal impact of immigrants in Europe are wrong.

○ In fact, Jussim and others like him could never say that “stereotypes are generally accurate”, because they simply don’t have a random sample of stereotypes to study. They must choose, and as we’ve seen, there are many kinds of stereotypes, and Jussim seems to choose certain types. Importantly, no one ever claimed that every stereotype must be exactly opposite of reality.

● A critical issue with stereotypes is moreover ***why*** people believe them. People don’t need to have any idea of the statistics to hold a belief in their minds, which manifests as a generic belief about something. Apparently, despite Jussim claiming that “muslims are terrorists” simply means “more muslims are terrorists” to most people, he’s wrong. [This is shown by psychologists Cimpian and Hammond in a series of 4 studies conducted on the matter. They find that:](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313670518_Investigating_the_cognitive_structure_of_stereotypes_Generic_beliefs_about_groups_predict_social_judgments_better_than_statistical_beliefs)

○ Generic beliefs *(“doctors are smart”)* **play a much larger role in determining stereotypes than statistical beliefs** *(“% of doctors are smart”).*

○ Generic beliefs are in much larger abundance among intuitive thinkers than analytical thinkers. This is interesting, because [numerous studies show that feelings-based contact with deeply prejudiced and cognitively rigid persons is most effective at making them less prejudiced towards that group, even more than more than less prejudiced persons.](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TrLqG-EDiNGmKa5Ued3bqY6bd0qozXBGahvPMcGnFXM/edit%23bookmark=id.4fz3i4ec15ci) This indicates that stereotypes are largely not at all about statistics, but about experiences and preconceptions of an entire group. Notice how, when this person becomes less prejudiced, nothing changes about the real statistics.

● [In a literature review of the topic of stereotype accuracy, psychologists Cimpian and Bian further find that:](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315539255_Are_stereotypes_accurate_A_perspective_from_the_cognitive_science_of_concepts)

○ **Generic beliefs are often endorsed on the basis of scant statistical evidence**

■ *“Notably, generic beliefs based on limited statistical evidence have also been observed in more controlled settings – for example, in laboratory studies where participants were given information about the prevalence of various traits in unfamiliar categories and then tested for their endorsement of the corresponding generic beliefs (e.g., Brandone, Gelman, & Hedglen, 2015; Cimpian et al., 2010). Thus, several types of evidence (obtained with participants spanning the range from 4-year-olds to adults) suggest a disconnect between endorsement of generic beliefs and the underlying statistical facts.”*

■ Another example here would be the[ mistaken belief that immigrants to the EU, whether from the EU or from outside it, constitute a fiscal burden](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TrLqG-EDiNGmKa5Ued3bqY6bd0qozXBGahvPMcGnFXM/edit%23bookmark=id.urehbr94obr3)

■ Additional evidence: [Edyta Wajda, D. Karczewski, 2020](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Do-All-Eagles-Fly-High-The-Generic-Effect:-The-of-Wajda-Karczewski/6c6b80ffa76422ce7cca77f813476f6d5868abfa%23citing-papers)

● In this study, there were no significant differences in the acceptance of generic minority statements (where the prevalence of the trait is specific to a sub-group like gender, or a geographical area, i.e. “lions have manes”) and generic majority statements (“eagles fly high”). The same applies for their universal statement counterparts (“all lions have manes” and “all eagles fly high”). As such, this is evidence that actual statistical prevalence is much less important.

○ **Generic beliefs are resistant to counterevidence**

■ *“For example, 4-year-olds who first heard that PAGONS (an unfamiliar category) are friendly and were then shown a counterexample ended up generalizing this trait to novel pagons as frequently as children who did not see the counterexample (Chambers, Graham, & Turner, 2008), which suggests that the counterexample had no effect on their endorsement of the generic belief.”*

■ Additional evidence: [S. Leslie, S. Khemlani, S. Glucksberg, 2011](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Do-all-ducks-lay-eggs-The-generic-effect-Leslie-Khemlani/b41bd4f6bd68bb44da330a5933cb8b3b8b1e5cb2)

● Even when presented with counterevidence in several experiments, even acknowledging its existence in knowledge tasks beforehand, participants kept using universal language: “all ducks lay eggs”. This is even more broad-reaching than generic language.

■ Additional evidence: [Daniel Karczewskia, Edyta Wajdaa, Radosław Poniat, 2020](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344079156_Do_all_storks_fly_to_Africa_Universal_statements_and_the_generic_overgeneralization_effect)

● Compiles evidence from several studies, all of them using both counter-evidence and supporting evidence to see how context may affect answers. What this study brings to the table is to have in addition a comparison between several languages.

○  **English:**

■ generic: neutral 99.14 (3.12); contradictory 87.07 (0.86); supportive 100 (0);

■ quantifier all: neutral 80.56 (3.82); contradictory 48.15 (4.83); supportive 87.96 (3.14).

○ **Greek:**

■ **generic**: neutral 92.24% (2.49); contradictory 76.72% (3.94); supportive 95.69% (1.89);

■ **quantifier all**: neutral 70.54% (3.82); contradictory 51.79 (4.74); supportive 78.57 (3.89).

○ **Polish:**

■ In this case, the authors chose to use three scenarios: A, where the participants got no contradictory input. B, where the participants were made aware of gender differences. C, where explicit exceptions were mentioned (“albino tigers with white fur”)

■ [Results:](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://ibb.co/fq6mTQz)

○ We can see that with all 3 languages, and in all contexts, the generic statements remain extremely dominant, and, even when faced with contradictory information, the quantifier “all” is used by a very large proportion. It must also be kept in mind, that in reality, it’s not certain that you will face contradictory information, and you will make judgements without it.

● This study attempts to reduce the GOG (generic overgeneralization) effect by putting the participants in different contexts. More precisely, it tries to make them think analytically rather than intuitively when considering the universal statements.

● 90% accepted generic statements (“lions have manes”)

● 63% accepted false universal statements in the negative condition (when the statement is generally untrue, “lions have white skin”). In this case, the participants were prompted to accept the statement.

● 55% accepted it in the mixed control group (when the statement may be intuitively true or untrue)

● 49% when the statement seems true/positive statement (i.e. “elephants have grey skin”). In this case, the participants were prompted to reject the statement by thinking of counter-evidence.

● A powerful fact is that even though the authors prompted the participants to reject the universal statement in the positive case through counterexamples, 49% still accepted it. The opposite applies in the negative case. This indicates high resistance to counter-evidence.

○ **Generic beliefs give the impression of strong statistical support**

■ *“they nevertheless suggest – e.g., when expressed in conversation – that the relevant attributes are almost always present (Brandone et al., 2015; Cimpian et al., 2010)”*

■ *“most participants assume prevalence levels of greater than 90% when exposed to unfamiliar generic facts (Cimpian et al., 2010)”*

■ Additional evidence: [S. Khemlani, S. Leslie, S. Glucksberg, 2009](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Generics,-Prevalence,-and-Default-Inferences-Khemlani-Leslie/149ed4d904f6a818b845c2382dcd04360486e53c)

○ **Generic beliefs are accompanied by misleading explanatory intuitions**

■ *“Specifically, generic claims are consistently interpreted as conveying deep, inherent properties of the relevant categories (e.g., Cimpian & Cadena, 2010; Cimpian & Erickson, 2012; Cimpian & Markman, 2009, 2011; Gelman, Ware, &  Kleinberg, 2010; Rhodes et al., 2012; see also Cimpian & Salomon, 2014)”*

○ In addition, **experiences of a thing, or even particular or numbered instances of a thing told to someone, get boiled down into generic beliefs by both adults and children, meaning they are seen as “default”. In addition, people remember generics better** ([S. Gelman, Ingrid Sánchez Tapia, S. Leslie, 2015;](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Memory-for-generic-and-quantified-sentences-in-and-Gelman-Tapia/f3e336670ff410f375ecd8745a8ebea76de2c2e2) [S. Leslie, S. Gelman, 2012;](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quantified-statements-are-recalled-as-generics:-and-Leslie-Gelman/3619b9e8c52943065d6745ac07de7808622a93be) [S. Leslie, S. Khemlani, S.

Gelman, 2003; S. Leslie, 2008; Khemlani et al., 2012).

■ *“Khemlani et al.’s goal was to compare the extent to which these expectations are rooted in participants’ statistical estimates (e.g., what percentage of Asian people do you think are good at math?) vs. their generic beliefs (e.g., do you believe that ASIANS are good at math?). The results highlighted the powerful influence of generic beliefs. Although participants’ statistical estimates did explain unique variance in their expectations about unfamiliar individuals, their endorsement of the relevant generic beliefs was considerably more predictive of these judgments (with an effect size that was 53% larger).”*

○ Finally, when people hold stereotypes of a group, those stereotypes can very often be attributed to a subgroup of that group, yet applied to all members of the group. Often, the stereotype attributed to a subgroup also applies to subgroups in other groups. We will get to this later, but here is some evidence: ([Edyta Wajda, D. Karczewski, 2020](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Do-All-Eagles-Fly-High-The-Generic-Effect:-The-of-Wajda-Karczewski/6c6b80ffa76422ce7cca77f813476f6d5868abfa%23citing-papers); [S. Leslie, S. Khemlani, S. Glucksberg, 2011](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Do-all-ducks-lay-eggs-The-generic-effect-Leslie-Khemlani/b41bd4f6bd68bb44da330a5933cb8b3b8b1e5cb2)).

● In addition to the above, some of the studies which Jussim criticizes in his book “Social Perception and Social Reality” as not proving bias or a self-fulfilling prophecy do indeed prove that. **For instance, he criticizes [Rist (1970)](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://faculty.washington.edu/rsoder/EDUC310/310RistHarvardEdReview.pdf):**

○ Rist (1970) studies a classroom of kindergartners in France over 3 grades: kindergarten, 1st grade, and 2nd grade. It finds that the criteria by which the kindergarten teacher uses to put children in different reading groups, which she thinks are based on competence, are really more based on social class level, with the ones of lower class being placed overwhelmingly in the worse tables 2 and 3, instead of table 1, with the same class dynamic being at play between tables 2 and 3. Table 1 is given most of the attention by the teacher, while the others are neglected. In addition, the kids in the order of the tables began to discriminate against each other. In spite of this, all tables had the same IQ score by year's end.

○ This same “caste-system” carries over into grades 1 and 2 of school, with no mobility in the 1st grade, and extremely little in the 2nd. In the 1st grade, the children who were in table 2 and 3 were combined into table B, with one exception who was placed in table C. However, this was only the case because there were children who had repeated 1st grade who were all placed in table C, and as such, the teacher didn’t uplift the children in table 3 for any reason other than the presence of students who repeated the grade. Moreover, this shows that the class divide persists, with no students placed in tables 2 and 3 being placed in table A, and vice versa.

○ **Next, we will deal with Jussim’s response:**

■ The first issue Jussim takes is with the “lack of outcome data”, which he claims makes it not conclude discrimination. However, we do have IQ scores at the end of the year, and those were the same for all tables. If the students were placed in tables based on intelligence, this wouldn’t be the case. **It must also be remembered that the treatment of the kids affects their outcomes at the end of the year.** If anything, then, after a year of neglect, this seems to show that students in tables 2 and 3 fared much better than expected, and weakly suggests that they’re more capable than students in table 1.

■ We also know how the teacher made her categorizations in the first place: she based them off of characteristics which correlate heavily with socioeconomic status, even though she thought she made them based on merit. Thus, the initial divisions she made turned into a self-fulfilling prophecy.

■ Jussim then goes on to claim that there’s no caste system, because as he says it, tables 2 and 3 were merged into table B next year, with one exception going to table C. However, as we know, this happened because there were repeat students in the class. And even if we were to accept it, it really wouldn’t change the existence of a self-fulfilling prophecy or a caste-system.

■ Jussim finally proceeds to refer to studies which disagree with Rist (1970), and notably delves into Williams (1976). [However, there are substantial issues with this study, listed here.](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JF39a9qD3L26TeuAa9xVfQVTW9SRAwZlKzGgfKqjeao/edit)

● Finally, even if a stereotype is statistically accurate, it may yet be the result of a statistical fallacy *(and can be self-fulfilling)*. I show this in the following example.

○ Just because **some x are like that, doesn’t mean some y aren’t like that either.** In which case, **why use the classifications x and y?**

■ Consider the following: “**What causes crime in black people is also what causes crime in *poor* white people**.”

■ This must then mean that while black people commit more crime, **it says nothing inherent about being black.**

■ So, all Jussim is doing is saying "**people have an accurate view of what the environment causes"**, not **"people have an accurate view of the true nature of x group"**, Because that **ALSO** applies for parts of y group.

■ Potentially, it also **DOESN'T** apply to some parts of x group as well

■ **And what causes both phenomena is unrelated to both.** That is, **being a white person isn’t what causes stereotypes around poor white people, just as being black isn’t (primarily) what causes stereotypes around them.** Both these groups are stereotyped as being more criminal **because they are poorer.**

■ As such, **why use the classifications “black” and “white” to identify crime, rather than poverty?**

○ As such, within a large group, like black people, there might simply be a smaller group of criminal people, which would on average make the larger group of black people seem, on average, more criminal. But this would then be a generalization that doesn’t cover nearly enough of the groups which have criminality. The stereotype then *also* covers those who don’t commit crime.

■ Consider the following; the set of black people contains the elements (a,b,c), while the set of white people contains the elements (c,d,e). Now, consider that elements b and c are “criminally prone” elements. It makes sense that people might, on average, stereotype the set of black people more than the set of white people based on crime due to those elements. However, it says nothing about the other non-crime prone elements within that set. As such, they are wrongfully stereotyped *(**it also indicates a self-fulfilling prophecy, does it not?**)*. If this is the case, again, why use the categories “black” and “white” when dealing with said crime, rather than simply dealing with criminality?

■ More fundamentally, it says nothing about any causal factor. Could it be that something else, like poverty, causes the criminality in both b and c, and it just so happens that the set of black people includes a larger proportion of those? Could it also be that, instead of stereotypes being accurate, that stereotypes instead perpetuate themselves, at least to a degree? Could it even be that these self-perpetuating steretypes lead to real-world consequences like discrimination that contribute to black poverty and therefore crime? Yes, that is exactly the case. And the fact that two elements of black people are “criminally-prone” while only one white is then is the result of that self-fulfilling prophecy.

○ **If there are groups of people like that in both x and y, there must therefore be something in common among those elements.** When it comes to crime, that would be the level of income, education, and neighborhood segregation.

○ **Consider a sample of both black and white people with the same income and education levels, and living in the same neighborhoods.** Would the black people in the sample not still be disadvantaged, in spite of their equal levels at the time, leading to disparate outcomes down the line? That small remaining difference is stereotypes *justifying themselves.* The stereotypes are a result of stereotypes perpetuating themselves.

■ Consider here the fact that studies show that black people with identical CVs and education levels get called back for job interviews at half the rate of white people.

■ Consider also that even for black and white people of the same socioeconomic status, black people are stopped and searched by the police more often.

■ Finally, consider that research has shown that, when a person thinks of themselves as part of a dominant group, differences in test results (often) disappear. Simply *imagining* that you’re part of another group makes you perform as well as them (or at least better). Additionally, black people having to indicate their race before taking a test *also* lowers their test scores. This indicates these stereotypes aren’t inherent.

■ In addition, because of past discrimination against black people, there is a larger group of poorer black people, who commit more crime and are discriminated against today, and these stereotypes affect even parts of the group which *aren’t* like that. Who are, I add, the vast majority. That is, even black people who don’t commit crime, or who have a good work ethic, or come from a good home, are affected by this discrimination, simply by being black. This also constitutes stereotypes justifying themselves, it constitutes a self-fulfilling prophecy. And again, if this is the case, what sense is there in a stereotype which says “black people commit more crime”, when it is rather poor people who commit more crime. It thus becomes a statistical fallacy.

○ If we synthesize everything, we can see that parts of the stereotypes against black people are self-perpetuating, with stereotypes against black people creating poverty, regardless of whether those black people commit crime, creating thus more crime. **A self-fulfilling prophecy.** We can also see that poverty perpetuates itself, and thus also recreates a stereotype of criminality.
## Stereotype threat:
● Jussim’s attacks here are particularly weak. His criticism of stereotype threat is that it lacks a “perceiver”, that is, someone who directly stereotypes the “target”, and instead he target stereotypes themselves. He then says this can’t constitute a self-fulfilling prophecy. However, this isn’t true, as stereotypes do in fact manifest on a societal level and internalize in people, and don’t have to involve two people. So when Jussim says: *“Self-fulfilling prophecies refer to **someone**’s false belief that leads to its own fulfillment.”,* why can’t that ***someone*** be the person stereotyped themselves?

● His other attack is almost equally vacuous. He says that stereotype threat doesn’t account for all differences in academic performance between black and white students. Luckily for everyone, this is not claimed. Other factors, like stereotyping by a *“perciever”*, as well as generational effects of discrimination, are at play.

● With respect to other criticisms, [a recent 2020 meta-analysis of the literature used 3 intervention type categories: belief-based, identity-based, and resilience-based stereotype threat interventions (STIs).](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343149798_Effectiveness_of_Stereotype_Threat_Interventions_A_Meta-Analytic_Review)

○ The meta-analyses combined 251 effect sizes from 181 experiments, and found an overall effect size of d = 0.44, with the intervention group outperforming the control group.

○ In addition, while all 3 intervention types helped counter stereotype threat, **belief-based and identity-based interventions** (primary-appraisal - strategies that remove the individuals’ stereotype threat) **were more effective than resilience-based interventions** (secondary-appraisal - strategies to make individuals of a certain identity cope better with their environment of stereotype threat).

○ 9 of 11 intervention strategies showed significant effect sizes upon examination.

○ Importantly for this, even after accounting for the publication bias which was found in some - but not all - intervention types, effect sizes all remained significant. Interestingly, the publication bias mostly affected resilience-based strategies.

**CLAIM: This study says to interpret with caution (they can’t conclude discrimination exists).**

● Studies can’t empirically verify intent. Put simply you just don’t know off of your five senses what another person is thinking. So the most accurate thing is to say that: you don’t know. You can’t conclude whether or not they have discriminatory intent or not. The way these studies work is that they make scientific conclusions based off of the available evidence, however, they never make sociological conclusions because they’re criminological studies. When these studies say the conclusion shouldn’t be drawn, what they’re indicating is that these are criminological studies that can be used only to describe patterns in data. These patterns are that black people are treated unfairly when you isolate race as a variable. Scientists very rarely use absolute terms even when something has a 99.9% chance of happening it is still overwhelmingly likely.

○ We see this in published biomedical literature as well yet they’re still used in the biomedical field. A cursory scan of published biomedical literature reveals close variants of the phrase: “These results, however, should be interpreted with caution.” Searching PubMed abstracts for the phrase “interpret∗ caution” retrieves 555 citations published between January 2010 and August 2011, and screening the first 100 abstracts reveals that 90 indeed contain this phrase in full and in 79 of them it appears in the conclusion sections of abstracts for primary studies and systematic reviews, potentially leaving in the mind of the reader the lingering and unsettling feeling of uncertainty in comprehending the results. This poses the obvious question to the many authors who rely on closing with this ineffectual and weakening phrase and to all editors who allow its persistence: what precisely does it mean to interpret with caution? There is no standard by which the reader can know how to interpret the results with caution and furthermore, how to modify future decisions (either in clinical practice or for future research) based on this universal warning. Of course, to interpret results with caution means, the authors claim that, though the methods are valid, they are based on some moderately unsound principles or assumptions. There is nothing inherently wrong with this, as the warning to interpret with caution is nearly always coupled with reasons why. (Those that close with this phrase but without qualification are especially egregious in giving their open-ended warning.) However, these reasons are different within every publication despite that the exact same warning is given again and again. This phrase has been so overused that it has truly lost its function and moreover its meaning. I contend that if the burden of final interpretation lies with the reader (as is certainly the case), the phrase “interpreted with caution” ought to be dropped altogether. If reasons are provided for limitations or stretches in logical steps, then this is sufficient for any reader to make his or her interpretation, because ultimately, to “interpret with caution” is an ambiguous undertaking.

**CLAIM: This study didn’t take (x minor variable) into account.**

● If someone makes this claim, they’re making a positive statement. In order for a study to have a statistically significant variable, they need to have a very low p-value which means that there’s usually a low 5% probability we would have gotten the data that we did randomly if the null hypothesis was true i.e “there’s no discrimination”. To prescribe the not controlled variable as an explanatory variable, they’d have to establish a link to disparate outcomes. Anything could theoretically account for a disparity in multivariate regression, unobserved or not, but unless the counter explanation is backed up, we still say the racial discrimination hypothesis is consistent. So they’d have to do a few things:

○ Prove the not controlled variable is not independent.

○ Prove how the not controlled variable has a significant effect.

○ Prove how black people disproportionately engage in the not controlled variable.

○ Prove how black people disproportionately engage in the not controlled variable that would account for all of the disparity.

○ Prove how the not controlled variable correlates with the dependent variable to the point it suggests it is causal.

○ Prove how the not controlled variable correlates with at least one independent variable in the regression.

■ Even if you do include it into the regression the results could still indicate that the omitted variable and race can still be statistically significant with a positive correlation.

○ Prove how the residuals in the models violated the OLS assumptions and Guass-Markov theorem then reduces the goodness-of-fit from larger residuals and biased the coefficient estimates.

○ Prove coefficients change if you include different combinations of independent variables in the model.

○ Prove how the coefficients are precise by tracking the precision through confidence intervals and coefficient estimates.

○ Prove how when including the confounded invariably doesn’t introduce multicollinearity in the model.

● Systemic racism is a field of study that uses inductive reasoning. Including too many variables in a model can lead to overfitting which can produce biased results. In disparate impact testing, the primary statistical concern is most often “included variable bias” – the worry that the statistical estimates of disparate impact are biased because the regression inappropriately includes non-race variables.

■ *“Originated upon the rise of empires, since its birth, race has been conceived as a way of organizing exploitation, and more generally subjugation, of Jews, Muslims and other non-whites in the forms of religious-based stigmatization and exclusion; slavery, segregation and mass deportation. Race emerged as part of the colonial project not as an exogenous product, but within continuous circulations, borrowing and learning processes between external (colonial) and internal (within the metropole) strategies, observations, interpretations, beliefs and practices concerning personhood and morality. Colonies, in this process, largely functioned as laboratories for experimentation in social engineering in the metropole (Stoler 1997; Stoler and Cooper 1997).”*

■ *“Class formation is intimately part of racial hierarchies. The naturalization of class difference is deeply rooted in social organizations, material arrangements and social perceptions. In light of this, race is, as Stuart Hall (2002[l980], 62) maintained, “also the modality in which class is ‘lived,’ the medium through which it is appropriated and ‘fought through.’ Race and class, therefore, are mutually linked; their link is historically inscribed in the colonial encounter, which structured “native” societies around the naturalization of gendered class hierarchies, and in which the poor were infantilized and deemed “naturally” at a lower stage of civilization. This remains chiefly relevant today as a principle reproducing global inequality between the wealthier, largely white Global North, and the poorer, mostly nonwhite Global South (Winant 2004). Due to relational constitution of race, it becomes clear how racial dynamics happen in various and changing ways according to each social context, and unfold in sometimes totally unpredictable manners. Disclosing these processes, therefore, implies keeping categories of analysis open and malleable to the encountered realities.”* [pg. 9]

**CLAIM: Africans sold their own into slavery.**

● The Africans who were placed on board the ships of the Atlantic Slave Trade were prisoners of war from other African Tribes, people deemed criminals, and poor members of society traded to pay off their debt. It’s important to remember that being a prisoner of war or a poor member of society traded for goods is not the same as being held in inter generational hereditary chattel slavery. I.e generations of children being born into bondage.

**CLAIM: Anthony Johnson was the first slave owner and he was black.**

● “In 1621, Johnson was delivered to Virginia’s shores as an African captive, simply called “Antonio.” By the mid-17th century, he became a landowner newly named “Anthony Johnson.” His ability to gain freedom resembles the functions of indentured servitude, in which an unfree laborer is bound to work for a landowner for a specific length of time. Once they satisfied the terms of their indenture, they could freely acquire land and capital. Since Anthony Johnson was an unfree laborer of African descent, his freedom and property acquisitions remain a source of confusion for Americans who are otherwise unfamiliar with how slavery evolved throughout the early decades of English colonialism. A central debate surrounding the parameters of colonial bondage was the status of captive workers, specifically in identifying “servants” vs. “slaves.” It is important to note that terminology was generally more fluid in the 17th century when compared to the hardened identities that emerged in the 18th and 19th centuries. Historians Linda Heywood and John Thornton note that the English borrowed some of their descriptive words from other transatlantic enslavers, and such terms often did not acquire definitive legal classifications until the end of the 17th century. We are also limited by documents that rarely comment on the conditions of bound people with much specificity. However, it becomes clear by the mid-17th century that Africans were being defined differently than white servants, as many Africans were defined as “lifetime” servants, suggesting that the precursors for perpetual, inherited slavery were being linked with racial classifications. By 1651, Johnson gained his freedom and acquired land and servants, eventually attaining legal ownership “for life” over a Black man named John Casor, a condition that separated servitude (labor for time) from slavery (labor for life). In 2010, Glenn Beck asserted that this case reveals how Johnson owned the first “state-sponsored slave” in American history, and like-minded commentators unsurprisingly agree. In the same episode, Beck insisted that Johnson’s story proves that slavery is a “human problem. … It’s not a white condition or a black condition.” As the narrative goes, if a Black man also owned enslaved people of African descent, it assumes that economics, not racism, bolstered US chattel slavery. For Beck, the existence of Black slaveowners inverts the narrative that American slavery was predicated on white supremacy. However, this narrow framework ignores preceding cases and misrepresents slavery’s complex evolution in the British Atlantic colonies. The existing scholarship indicates that John Punch was the first man known to be perpetually enslaved on July 9, 1640, a punishment he received for attempting to flee his indenture. He absconded alongside two fellow servants, a “dutchman” named Victor and a “Scotchman called James Gregory.” Following their apprehension, his counterparts each received only one additional year upon their indenture, while Punch, listed as a “negro,” was enslaved “for the time of his natural Life.” Punch’s sentence documents an early framework for the growing attachment between Blackness and enslavement in North America, as the indentured white men did not receive similar punishment. Thus, Hugh Gwyn, the man who owned John Punch, would be the first recognized slaveholder, eliminating the spurious claim that a Black man innovated the North American system. Punch’s experience certainly foreshadowed legal maneuvers in the 18th century. As more African “servants” became permanently enslaved, their status was transmitted to their children. As historian Jennifer Morgan notes, it was this pairing of race, reproduction, and heritability that determined the racialization of chattel slavery in the Western Hemisphere. To be sure, some secondary works have proposed that African and European bonds-people shared a similar status in colonial Virginia. Historians T.H. Breen and Stephen Innes, whose book Myne Owne Ground is considered the first extensive study of Johnson’s life, claimed that prior to the close of the 17th century, “Englishmen and Africans could interact with one another on terms of relative equality for two generations.” However, historians like Alden T. Vaughan, Lorena Walsh, and Michael Guasco reevaluated the status of such captive Africans in Virginia and elsewhere, concluding that early laws for people of African descent were often determined by their color (not the case for Europeans) and miscegenation laws were specifically designed to preserve the purity of white Europeans. Indeed, in John Punch’s case, his European counterparts each held nationalities, while he was solely defined by a socially-constructed racial identity. Walsh contends that the few Africans who came to the Chesapeake colonies as indentured servants have “confused the issue of the fate of the great majority,” arguing that, unlike European bonds-people, most captive Africans lacked basic information in the documents, including names, ages, and arrival dates. They were rendered anonymous in the historical record, differentiating them from European servants who at least maintained an ethnic identifier beyond their indenture. Thus, even if Africans were not “enslaved” by the later standards of the 19th century, they were certainly not viewed as equal to white servants. These early distinctions eventually shifted toward concrete identifications of chattel enslavement and its explicit links to Blackness throughout the Atlantic. Even if Anthony Johnson was the first person in the North American colonies to hold a slave—even if many black people across the years held slaves—that doesn’t erase the fact that it was the racially based system of hereditary slavery that harmed the vast majority of black people living within it. The fact that some members of an oppressed class participate in oppression doesn’t excuse that oppression. In order for New World slavery to not be about race, we'd need a lot more counterexamples than Anthony Johnson. There are black slaveholders, but there are no white slaves except for a handful of Slavs that show up in Havana circa 1500. They're remnants of the previous Mediterranean-based slave trade. We would also have to ignore the centuries after Johnson's time when, however slavery was ordered in early Virginia, it became a system of whites owning blacks. To point to extremely rare exceptions to an overwhelming trend is willful blindness at best. But let's look at Johnson's world. He's not one of the first "twenty Negars" that John Rolfe reports coming to Jamestown in 1619, but he does arrive quite early, in 1621. At this point, records know him as "Antonio a Negro." He arrives in a Chesapeake that is not yet a slave society. Human cargoes arrive in fits and starts, usually small groups. Most of them probably didn't come directly from Africa, but instead had previously been enslaved in the West Indies. Johnson, like most of them, probably had some familiarity with European culture and Christianity. His name suggests prior residence in Spanish colonies. At the time of Johnson's arrival, not enough slaves exist in Virginia for their presence to demand any kind of thoroughgoing system to manage their lives. Slavery doesn't even exist in law. It's unclear exactly what happened on the ground and day to day, but in at least some cases they are not understood as slaves for life so much as a variety of indentured servant who might someday become free. That doesn't mean life's a party, but it's a hierarchical society with many grades of freedom and unfreedom rather than one oriented around a slave-free or black-white binary. Johnson was sold to the Bennett family and survived a raid on the colony in 1622. He proved himself a loyal, hardworking sort. Johnson probably had experience winning favor like that from his previous life, since it's one of the ways you got ahead in the Atlantic World. Likewise you tried to outwardly assimilate to the locally dominant culture. It seems to have worked for Johnson, since the Benetts let him operate his own farm, get married (to a woman called Mary), and when he had kids they got baptized. These were all things that could be denied to a slave; baptism could even have freed his children, though I'm not sure precisely when that law was changed. Johnson and his family get their freedom and Johnson sets out for further assimilation. Antonio becomes Anthony and he takes his hyper-English surname. Anthony, Mary, and their four kids follow the Bennetts to the Eastern Shore in 1640 and set up an independent farm. It goes well enough that in 1651, Johnson earns a 250 acre grant for sponsoring the transport of indentured servants to Virginia. That's a big chunk of land for the time. Two of his sons do quite well on top of that. Johnson's plantation burns in 1653, but he petitions the colony for relief on the grounds of longtime residence and loyal service. That gets him a tax abatement to help in rebuilding. It appears that the Johnsons, once free, were treated roughly as well as whites. It wouldn't surprise me to find out that they dealt with some casual mistreatment or social isolation, but he and others owned slaves and had rights to property (slaves included) which the courts respected against encroachments by white men. That brings us to one of his slaves, John Casar. (There are various spellings of Casar's surname. Casor is the one I see most often.) Casar was a slave of Johnson's who ran off, probably with the encouragement of some of Johnson's white neighbors. Johnson sued for Casar's return and won it, plus some damages. There are many reasons the courts might have respected Johnson's right to his slave, aside the simple fact of the law. One is that on the ground there's not a lot of division between the enslavers, the enslaved, and indentured whites. We're not looking at Cotton Kingdom era plantations with a hundred slaves, an overseer, and a staff of drivers. For the most part, when the fields need working the owner is out there with the property and probably any children of age. The customary rules of labor carry over from contemporary British law, rather than a formal slave code. That grants the employer/owner a lot of power, but does also promise some rights to the workers and those seem to have been respected. (Though there's more mistreatment in Virginia than contemporary England and the slaves would have gotten worse than mere servants.) Those included Sundays and half Saturday off, plus a big break about lunch time. Masters also had to provide for their employees, enslaved or otherwise, and often resorted to the courts for discipline rather than taking it on themselves. You have to go ahead to the 1700s to see enslavers as absolute masters of their domains. The gulf between a slave and a servant, while meaningful, is substantially less than it would later be. Big picture, a disregard for what we'd call human rights is the order of the day. It's not an endless parade of misery, but most of the ordure descends the incline similarly regardless of one's color. That means it can be horrible, but the doors open to whites to advance are also open to blacks. Johnson's the most famous one who got through them. All of this changes over the course of the later 1600s, as the number of slaves increases and indentured whites become less reliable (in part because they stop dying so often) and less plentiful. There's a long process by which slavery is consolidated and a gulf opens between slavery and other forms of unfreedom at the lower end of the hierarchy. The line is drawn by color and descent. To be black comes to mean being a slave and whites, by contrast are free(ish). To have an enslaved mother, who is black by definition, then makes one a slave by force of law. The cultural space for free black people shrinks, eventually to the point where Johnson's descendants quit the colony.” “The man being referred to is Anthony Johnson, who was an indentured servant who earned his freedom. He purchased a couple of indentured servants of his own, and in 1653, those servants either ran away or were let go. In 1655 Johnson won a court case against one of those servants who was ordered back into service with Johnson as a "servant for life". This is the basis for the claim that Anthony Johnson was the first slave owner in America. Several problems with this.

○ 1.) The first non-natively owned slaves in the Americas were native peoples in South America

○ 2.) The first slaves in North America were also native peoples enslaved by Europeans.

○ 3.) The first African slaves in the Americas were enslaved by the Spanish in Portuguese in South America.

○ 4.) The first African slaves in North America were Spanish slaves as part of the San Miguel de Gualdape which was established in 1526. Other Spanish sites in North America had African slaves long before Anthony Johnson came along.

○ 5.) The first indentured servants arrived in America within the first decade after the settlement at Jamestown.

○ 6.) The first black people in English colonies in Jamestown arrived in 1619 as indentured servants.

○ 7.) John Winthrop of Massachusetts and Samuel Maverick of Massachusetts both owned slaves before 1630. Winthrop arrived by 1630, Maverick was in Massachusetts by 1625.

○ 8.) In 1638 some Pequot Indians taken in raids were exchanged for African slaves/servants in the West Indies. This would not be the last time this would happen.

○ 9.) In 1641 Massachusetts would pass it's first slave law.

○ 10.) In 1640 John Punch was sentenced to indentured servitude for life by a Virginia court for attempting to run away to Maryland.

○ 11.) Anthony Johnson would not win his case against Castor until 1655, at \*least\* 15 years after the first confirmed court case of indentured servitude for life.

○ 12.) The United States didn't exist in 1655.

● So, no matter what way we look at it, there's absolutely no way in which Anthony Johnson can be considered the first slave owner in the United States.” [https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2mhnpc/anthony_johnson_shows_up_in_askreddit_yet_again/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2mhnpc/anthony_johnson_shows_up_in_askreddit_yet_again/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) [https://www.aaihs.org/the-curious-history-of-anthony-johnson-from-captive-african-to-right-wing-talking-point/](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.aaihs.org/the-curious-history-of-anthony-johnson-from-captive-african-to-right-wing-talking-point/)

**CLAIM: White people were slaves too.**

● The claim that Irish people were enslaved in the British American Colonies stems from a misrepresentation of the idea of “indentured servitude.” Indentured servants were people required to complete unpaid labor for a contracted period. While the majority of Irish people who became indentured servants in the Colonies did so willingly (why they felt they had to so is, of course, another question), a not insignificant number were forcibly deported and sold into indentured servitude. Many indentured servants in the British colonies were working-class white immigrants from the British Isles, including thousands of Irish people. Indentured servants were often treated horribly by their masters, many dying before they were set free. Crucially, indentured servants were considered human beings under the law. African slaves were seen as property rather than people; Africans were racialized as Black to cement this enslaved status as permanent, inheritable and justifiable in the natural order. An indenture implies two people have entered into a contract with each other but slavery is not a contract. It is often about being a prisoner of war or being bought or sold bodily as part of a trade. That is a critical distinction. This lack of legal and social personhood, as well as accompanying racist ideologies, let slave owners justify the many horrors inflicted on African slaves at mass scale. Millions of Africans were shipped to the Americas and forced into unprecedentedly cruel conditions, both in terms of scale and severity. African slaves had no legally recognized rights. They were regarded as private property over which owners claimed absolute authority, a fundamental characteristic of slave status in all New World slave societies.

○ **Barbary Slave Trade**

● The Barbary Slave Trade was not a parallel to white European/Americans' enslavement of black Africans. The Barbary city-states allowed, encouraged their captives to be ransomed back to Europe (and in a couple cases later on, America) for money. Judging by names on the records, 40-60% of corsair captains doing the actual raiding and enslaving were white Europeans who had nominally converted to Islam for profit and marauding. The actual period of enslavement for labor was relatively short, ending in the 17C, although kidnapping for ransom continued and tapered off in early 19C. (ETA) The Barbary trade was not limited to western European slaves. They labored alongside sub-Saharan Africans, eastern Europeans, and perhaps non-Muslim central Asians. There is no discernible impact on Europe's economy from the (temporary) loss of people, or money paid out in ransom, or even really the hit to company and military coffers from the loss of ships. (This is actually kind of a mystery to historians, leading many to doubt whether the Barbary slave trade was as numerically large as other scholars have calculated.) The trans-Atlantic slave trade represented the systematic, long-term, broad-scale destruction of nations, peoples, and people. Slavery as an institution has existed for a very long time. What differentiates the transatlantic slave trade from the Barbary slave trade, Saharan slave trade, and other large scale movements of chattel slavery was the racial nature of the trade and the sheer volume of the trade. As a way to justify slavery, which was viewed negatively by Christian religious texts, white European slavers pushed the idea that black African slaves were subhumans who needed to be civilized through slavery. This is an idea that was unique to the European slave trade compared to other large scale slave trades. European powers also shipped nearly 13 million African slaves to the new world, an unthinkably massive number and much larger than other slave trades.

**CLAIM: People in the past didn’t know slavery was wrong.**

● Slavery was a contentious issue from the start. In the original draft of the declaration of independence, Thomas Jefferson called slavery and the slave trade a crime against humanity and condemned it. This was cut out of the document due to South Carolina and Georgia’s objection. At the Constitutional Convention, southern states said that if slavery was abolished or if the slave trade was regulated, they wouldn't join the union. In fact, this debate got so heated that the South nearly walked out of the convention. Around the time of the convention, 7 of the 13 states had abolished slavery already and 10 of them had banned the slave trade. Immediately following the convention, Black men could vote in 6 states. The House of Representatives which was controlled by the South for a bit censored the mail to prevent abolition pamphlets from going to the South and they instituted a gag rule on slavery so that it couldn't be discussed in congress. The idea that no one knew slavery was wrong is false and to say that those who opposed it were a minority is also false. To say that is to ignore a lot of things the Founders said, the North's opposition to it, and that Europe had abolished slavery long before America.

**CLAIM: Only a small percentage of white people owned slaves**

● The number was between 20 and 25%, and in some states, the rate was twice as high. According to the 1860 census every third white person in those states had a direct commitment to slavery.

# **Defending Juneteenth**
**This is a relatively minor issue, but worth including just for when it comes around on the calendar (also because most of the arguments against Juneteenth are embarrassingly bad, so it’s more fun to rebut them)**

● **"It's a race-based holiday and that's bad!"** Juneteenth is a celebration of racial progress (a good thing to celebrate), and we already have MLK day, which also has a focus on race and racial progress. In addition to opposing Juneteenth, these people would also be consistent in opposing MLK day, even though none of them seem to have a problem with that holiday (suggesting race-related holidays aren't necessarily bad).

● **"It's part of the democrat/marxist/CRT agenda!"** Unsurprisingly, you can celebrate the abolition of slavery without supporting marxism or CRT or whatever. You can even paint the holiday in a pro-republican light if you wanted to (in the 1800s, republicans were the anti-slavery party). Even if it is democrat/marxist/CRT, republicans (who oppose democrats, marxism, and CRT) certainly didn't view the holiday like that - it had strong bipartisan support in congress, with every single senate republican voting in favor and almost every house republican. Even Trump wanted to make Juneteenth a national holiday, something he included in his Platinum Plan for Black Americans. In fact, many GOP-oriented commentators had no problem with Juneteenth until this year - [Charlie Kirk](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://twitter.com/FrankLuntz/status/1405717239001587712), for example.

● **"Juneteenth detracts from July 4th! It's another summer holiday and gives black people their own independence day!"** Though Juneteenth does celebrate the advancement of black independence and freedom (that's what ending slavery does), it does not try to redefine the independence day for the country as a whole, nor does it try to obfuscate July 4th. Again, plenty of republican representatives and commentators (people who are usually pretty nationalist and really care about July 4th) understood this in the past or continue to understand that today, see the above response.

● **"It's a pointless virtue signal that doesn't lead to actual meaningful change."** For once, this is true. We should work towards meaningful policies which actually work to improve the condition of minority communities. However, it is worth noting that if Juneteenth doesn't really change anything, getting it repealed won't change anything either - so saying it's a virtue signal isn't a very compelling argument for *removing* the holiday. It's also worth noting that holidays in general are virtue signals that don't have much of an impact on the country - July 4th, for example, is essentially a virtue signal in support of American independence, but the fact that it’s just a virtue signal is not a compelling argument to stop celebrating July 4th.

● **"It's another pride day that we don't need. We already have gay pride month, black history month, and so on. Why do we need more pride celebrations?"** Celebrating the abolition of slavery isn't necessarily something only black people can take pride in, but rather it's something everyone can take pride in as a step forward for America as a whole. Also, we can brand plenty of holidays as "pride days" and then use that as a pretext to oppose them. Going back to July 4th, we could easily rebrand that as "American pride day" and then ask why we have yet another unneeded pride day on our calendars. What's essentially happening with Juneteenth in this case is the rebranding of "celebrating slavery's abolition" into "celebrating black pride" so it can be dismissed as another pride day.

○ Highlights the philosophical (social power and group power) and racial reasons why white police officers have a discriminatory bias against African-Americans

○ Data collected via nationally representative survey which focuses on a number of specific racial attitudes of police officers to gain a broader understanding of their racial views and biases

○ Finds that **officers believe blacks are more violent, lazy, and should not be given special treatment** compared to most whites

○ Further highlights that **those with less education adopt conservative views on race** and the harmful impacts discrimination denial can have (i.e. shows how denial of racial discrimination can lead to the establishment of racial hierarchy)

○ Used body camera footage from Oakland, California in April 2014

○ Found that even after controlling for a number of factors, **racial disparities still existed in how police treated people**: “*We find that officers speak with consistently less respect toward black versus white community members, even after controlling for the race of the officer, the severity of the infraction, the location of the stop, and the outcome of the stop.*”

■ This is the case in spite of there being widespread police use of body cameras

○ WHY DISSIPATING DISPARITIES MATTER

○ PREFACE FOR THE UTILITY OF FAIRNESS IN STOPS, ETC... *“...There are two main reasons why criminologists are interested in fairness in the criminal justice system. One, the concept of fairness is intimately tied into legitimacy (Tyler, 2017; Tyler, Fagan, & Geller, 2014). Increasing perceptions of fairness is then expected to have downstream effects of the community cooperating with police, thus making investigations more effective (Braga et al., 2019).... The second reasons criminologists have been interested in fairness in police behavior, the extent to which a formal label results in negative long term consequences, is more closely tied to equality of outcomes. This line of research has been focused on how DMC subsequently produces negative consequences, for both individuals touched by the criminal justice system, as well as broader societal impacts. At the individual level, formal labelling by the criminal justice system results in negative consequences, such as the ability to gain employment (Pager, 2003). Even absent an arrest, simply being stopped by the police appears to prompt individuals to avoid different social institutions (Brayne, 2014; Lerman & Weaver, 2013). At the aggregate level, such police contacts, warrants, and arrests have become so prevalent in particular minority neighborhoods they appear to have influenced overall levels of social control, and subsequently promoted more criminal behavior (Clear, 2008; Fagan, West, & Holland, 2002; Goldkamp & Vîlcicã, 2008; Hannon & DeFina, 2012; Morenoff & Harding, 2014). ”* (Wheeler 19 [pg. 5-6]).

○ Examines through a longitudinal study differences in a nationally representative sample between 2,459 Black participants and 7,403 White Participants in waves throughout their adolescence, emerging adulthood, and young adulthood.

○ Finds that **“Black participants were arrested at a rate that was seven times more frequent than White participants”** and that **“Neither contextual nor behavioral differences account for the arrest disparity between those who are Black and those who are White.”**

○ This disparity was found despite having on average **less alcohol use, less drug use, and similar rates of delinquency** and **arrest in emerging adulthood.**

■ After holding the effect of contextual factors in adolescence, behaviors in emerging adulthood, and arrests in emerging adulthood constant, a significant difference in the number of arrests across race (S–B χd2iff(1) = 4.24, p < .05) emerges in young adulthood. Compared to those who identify as White (M = .62), those who identify as Black (M = 4.30) were arrested almost seven times more often.

○ Results showed significantly higher likelihood of having ever been arrested among blacks, when compared to whites, even after con- trolling for a range of delinquent behaviors. These black–white disparities were no longer present after accounting for racial composition of the neighborhood, supporting the growing body of research demonstrating the importance of contextual variables in driving disproportionate minority contact with the justice system.

■ After controlling for factors such as demographic characteristics, including gender, age, time in the USA, time in current residence, and region, as well as a range of delinquent and criminal behaviors, black people’s likelihood of arrest increased from 1.40 times more likely to 1.58 times more likely to be arrested compared to white people.

■ For every one percentage point increase in the proportion of individuals who are white, they are 44% less likely to be arrested after controlling for other factors such as crime rate.

■ While community characteristics such as crime rate (X2 = 13.78, p = 0.0171) were associated with the odds of being arrested, they were not the primary drivers of racial/ ethnic disparities.

○ Although self-reported offending is a significant predictor of which individuals are contacted/referred, levels of delinquent offending have only marginal effects on the level of disproportionate minority police contact. This finding held true for a measure of total offending and for violent and property offenses as well.

■ Although the African American prevalence rate of delinquent behavior ranges from 1.1 to 1.5 times that of Whites, the arrest and court referral rate is 1.5 to 3.4 times that of Whites.

■ For violent offenses, African Americans are 1.1 to 1.5 times more likely to report involvement in violent offenses but are 2 to almost 5 times more likely to be arrested or court referred than Whites. Also, African American violent offenders are roughly 2-5 times more likely to be arrested or referred to court. For property offenses, African Americans are 1.1 to 1.4 times more likely to report involvement in violent offenses but are roughly 1.4 to 3 times more likely to be arrested or referred to court than Whites, depending on the site; and African American property offenders are roughly 1.4 to 2 times more likely to be arrested or referred to court.

■ Being African American increases the logs odds of **expected counts of trouble with the police by 44.5%** when other variables like **offending are held constant.**

■ African Americans report **45.9% more trouble with the police than whites** even when other variables like **offending are controlled**.

○ Found that blacks and Latinos were **more likely to be searched** than whites (5.4 percent, 4.1 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively), even though **searches of white motorists were more likely than the others to turn up contraband** (whites: 32 percent, blacks: 29 percent, Latinos: 19 percent).

● [According to a Justice Department study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/pbtss11.pdf) released in 2013, throughout the United States, black drivers are about 30 percent more likely to be pulled over than white drivers. Black drivers are also more likely to be pulled over for alleged mechanical or equipment problems with their automobiles, or for record checks. White people are actually more likely to get pulled over for noticeable traffic violations such as speeding. Black drivers are more likely to not be told why they were pulled over.

# **Stop and Frisk**
● [An ACLU study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.aclum.org/sites/default/files/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/reports-black-brown-and-targeted.pdf) of stop and frisk incidents in Boston between 2007 and 2010 that did not result in a citation or arrest found that 63 percent of such stops were of black people. Blacks made up 24 percent of the city’s population. Incredibly, 97.5 percent of these encounters resulted in no arrest or seizure of contraband.

● [Another ACLU study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.aclu.org/blog/criminal-law-reform/reforming-police-practices/new-data-reveals-milwaukee-police-stops-are), this time on the use of stop-and-frisk in Milwaukee between 2010 and 2017, found that in nearly half of the more than 700,000 such stops, the police failed to demonstrate reasonable suspicion as required by the Constitution. The study found that between pedestrian stops and traffic stops, black people were six times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people, and that less than 1 percent of those searches turned up any contraband. Here again, while black and Latino drivers were more likely to be searched, they were 20 percent less likely to be in possession of any contraband.

○ Investigates disparities in police NYPD use of force during the use of stop-and-frisk-and there’s a *lot*

○ “The results, which appear in Table 2, show that black civilians **have 27 percent higher odds of experiencing force during a stop than white civilians and 28 percent higher odds of officers drawing their guns** (OR = 1.27 and 1.28, respectively). Importantly, these findings are net of alternative explanations including civilian behavior, the success of the stop, local crime rates, and neighborhood context.

○ ”Still, it is striking that **when police do not report any criminal behavior by stopped civilians, black individuals experience 29 percent higher odds of experiencing force than white individuals**. Turning to gun use in model 2, the results are again consistent with those in Table 2, albeit the magnitude of the race relationship is slightly smaller (OR = 1.20 compared to 1.28 in Table 2). **Nonetheless, together these results clearly demonstrate that the racial disparity persists even when individuals are not arrested nor found with contraband.**

○ Although the racial disparity is smaller for any force when police arrest individuals or find contraband and/or weapons compared to when they are innocent, t**he disparity grows monumentally for potential lethal force from 20 to 60 percent higher odds**. As further evidence that the race of the civilian is directly related to potential lethal force and not a proxy for behavioral differences, the odds ratios for civilian behavior decrease

○ For both productive and nonproductive stops, black civilians are more than three percentage points more likely to be subjected to force during a stop than white civilians.

○ Where the marginal effect is below 0.1 percentage points for stops in which the civilian was not arrested and no contraband or weapons were seized, it is greater than 0.4 percentage points at every age for stops that resulted in arrests and/or seizures. These differences are statistically significant. **In short, black civilians are more likely to experience potential lethal force when no criminal behavior is uncovered and the likelihood increases at least four fold when officers locate criminal activity.**

○ **If black civilians were treated identically to whites, we estimate that 61,207 fewer stops of black civilians would have included force and 1,814 fewer stops of black civilians would have involved police gun use.** Put differently, there would have been 21 fewer uses of force on black civilians per day and 4.4 fewer guns drawn on black civilians per week over our 8 years observation period.

○ The study also found “**no relationship between county-level racial bias in police shootings and crime rates (even race-specific crime rates)**, meaning that the racial bias observed in police shootings in this data set is **not explainable as a response to local-level crime rates.**” So, there is n**o evidence to suggest that the counties with relatively high black to white crime rate ratios are those with disproportionately high rates of racial disparities in police use of lethal force against unarmed individuals**.

○ Analysis of 33 years of data from Washington State to **determine which characteristics best predict the decision** to implement a **death sentence.**

○ **Black defendants** are **4.5 times** as likely to receive a **death sentence** as similarly-situated whites.

○ **Other factors** (presence of aggravating circumstances, involvement of sex crimes, hostage-taking, etc.) explain only a **small fraction of the disparity** in prosecutors’ and juries’ decision to **invoke the death penalty against black defendents.**

○ **Race** was by far the **most influential statistical factor.**

● [A study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1240&context=facpub) of death penalty rates of black perpetrators/white victims vs. white perpetrators/black victims through 1999 showed similar discrepancies. Interestingly, the study found that blacks are underrepresented on death row in proportion to the proportion of murders they commit. But this is largely because most black murderers kill other black people, and prosecutors are far less likely to seek the death penalty when the victim is black.

● [Black people are also more likely](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Documents/Race_and_Wrongful_Convictions.pdf) to be wrongly convicted of murder when the victim was white.

# **Prosecutors, Discretion, and Plea Bargaining**
**Depending on which study you look at, somewhere between 80 and 95 percent of criminal cases are resolved with a plea bargain before ever getting to trial. While [most legal observers](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/opinion/sunday/go-to-trial-crash-the-justice-system.html) agree that plea bargaining [is widely abused](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/plea-bargaining-courts-prosecutors/524112/) and [does little](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.economist.com/leaders/2014/10/04/a-plea-for-change) to serve the [interests](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/innocence-is-irrelevant/534171/) of justice, [most also believe](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://web.archive.org/web/20180522050257/http://www.vindy.com/news/2010/nov/14/gains-justice-system-8216would-grind-to-/) that if every defendant were to insist on a trial, the system would come [grinding to a halt](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://blog.simplejustice.us/2014/10/04/the-economist-discovers-plea-bargaining/). The bias here comes in when we look at who gets plea bargains, what kinds of deals they’re offered and how many, though innocent, feel pressured to accept.**

● [A 2017 study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3036726) of about 48,000 criminal cases in Wisconsin showed that white defendants were 25 percent more likely than black defendants to have their most serious charge dismissed in a plea bargain. Among defendants facing misdemeanor charges that could carry a sentence of incarceration, whites were 75 percent more likely to have those charges dropped, dismissed or reduced to a charge that did not include such a punishment.

● [A 2011 summary](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://bja.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh186/files/media/document/PleaBargainingResearchSummary.pdf) of the research on race and plea bargaining published by the Bureau of Justice Assistance concluded that “the majority of research on race and sentencing outcomes shows that blacks are less likely than whites to receive reduced pleas,” that “studies that assess the effects of race find that blacks are less likely to receive a reduced charge compared with whites,” and that “studies have generally found a relationship between race and whether or not a defendant receives a reduced charge.”

● [A 2013 study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.yalelawjournal.org/article/mandatory-sentencing-and-racial-disparity-assessing-the-role-of-prosecutors-and-the-effects-of-booker) found that after adjusting for numerous other variables, federal prosecutors were almost twice as likely to bring charges carrying mandatory minimums against black defendants as against white defendants accused of similar crimes.

The authors conclude that “assessments of dangerousness and culpability are linked to race and ethnicity, even after offense seriousness and prior record are controlled.”

# **Judges and Sentencing**
● [U.S. Sentencing Commission 17](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/research-publications/2017/20171114_Demographics.pdf)

○ Extensive multivariate regression analysis indicates **black male offenders receive 19.1% longer sentences than similarly-situated white male offenders** (white male offenders with similar past offenses, socioeconomic background, etc.)

■ Keep in mind that multivariate regression analysis is imperfect and can’t demonstrate causation, this is likely to be pointed out as a limitation if the other person is familiar with the study. This specific study tries to account for those sorts of limitations [from an earlier 2012 report](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/news/congressional-testimony-and-reports/booker-reports/2012-booker/Part_A.pdf), meaning the authors have already recognized and meaningfully tried to account for limitations like these.

○ This disparity seems to stem mostly from **black males being 21.2% less likely to receive non-government sponsored downward departures or variances**.

■ **Non-government sponsored departures and variances** refer to deviations from standard sentencing guidelines due to **judicial discretion**.

○ Black males who **do receive** non government-sponsored departures and variations **still serve 16.8% longer sentences than white males on average**.

○ In contrast, **when sentencing length follows standard guidelines, that disparity is only 7.9%**, and a substantial assistance departure for both groups **nullifies that disparity**.

○ **IN SUMMARY** - much of the sentencing disparity between **similarly situated black males and white males** comes down to **judicial discretion** to **deviate from standard sentencing guidelines.**

○ **BONUS -** regression analysis suggests **violence in a criminal’s history does NOT** explain **sentencing disparities between black males and similarly situated white males** - the effect of that factor seems to be **statistically insignificant.**

○ **ADDENDUM -** Some have asked to clarify a sentence at the end of this report, where its authors write it cannot be used to prove discrimination on the part of judges. First, that disclaimer warns against inferring active discrimination as opposed to implicit bias - **the disclaimer does not say the report cannot be used to prove implicit bias**. Second, researchers are often quick to point out that their research cannot prove a point, especially regarding intent. **It can only strongly suggest a point -  natural limitation of multivariate regression analysis**.

● [A 2015 study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/msen/files/sen_reversal.pdf) in the Journal of Legal Studies found that black federal judges are about 10 percentage points more likely to be reversed on appeal than white federal judges. The study adjusted for variables like who appointed the judges, judicial circuits and demographic data.

○ **Meta-analysis of 71 studies**

○ “*Analyses indicate that **African-Americans generally are sentenced more harshly than whites**; the magnitude of this race effect is statistically significant but small and highly variable*”

■ High variability is explained by differences in methodology between studies

○ Specifically, **African-Americans are 1.28 times more likely to be punished more harshly than white people** on average.

○ They are **1.13 times more likely to be punished harsher than white people** when even after taking into account **precision of measurement and presence of key variables** (i.e utilizing more precise measures of **criminal history and offense seriousness,** and included controls for both **type of defense counsel and method of disposition,** while holding **all other variables at their respective means**.)

○ “Examining the Impact of Race and Ethnicity on the Sentencing of Juveniles in the Adult Court”

○ *“The findings suggest that race and ethnicity do impact the sentencing outcomes of convicted youthful offenders. In addition, the results suggest that the combination of race and other factors (i.e., interactions) has an effect on sentencing.”*

○ *“We also found that the interaction of race and other factors further influence sentencing decisions. It is interesting that having prior contact with the juvenile justice system and **being Black increased the likelihood of receiving prison versus jail, and it decreased the likelihood of the same for Whites.** These opposite findings could mean that judges view prior record differently for these racial groups, with prior records representing more dangerousness for Blacks (i.e., greater chance of prison) but not for Whites (i.e., lower chance of prison).”*

○ In a review of 40 studies into the linkage between race and ethnicity and sentencing severity, researchers found that at both the state and federal levels, black people were more likely to receive more severe sentences than their white counterparts.

○ This finding holds true even when controlling for differences in criminal histories and the effects of policies that have a disparate impact on people of color, like drug laws and hot spots policing practices discussed in [these](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cassia-Spohn/publication/237754097_Thirty_Years_of_Sentencing_Reform_The_Quest_for_a_Racially_Neutral_Sentencing_Process/links/53f674170cf2fceacc735a5b/Thirty-Years-of-Sentencing-Reform-The-Quest-for-a-Racially-Neutral-Sentencing-Process.pdf?origin=publication_detail) [studies](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/research-publications/2017/20171114_Demographics.pdf).

○ 43% of studies at the state level and 68% at the federal level reported direct racially discriminatory sentencing outcomes, impacting both the initial decision to incarcerate and the length of any ultimate sentence to incarceration.

# **Prison and Incarceration**
**Black people are of course overrepresented in the prison population. And, as noted in one particular study below, they’re overrepresented even after you account for variables such as the crime rate among blacks.**

● [A 2016 Yale University study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://law.yale.edu/sites/default/files/area/center/liman/document/aimingtoreducetic.pdf) of solitary confinement in 48 jurisdictions across 45 states found that black prisoners were more likely to be held in isolation than white prisoners. The discrepancy was even greater among women — black women made up 24 percent of the female prison population but 41 percent of those who had been held in isolation (that figure came from 40 jurisdictions.)

● [A report](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Black-prisoners-in-Texas-more-likely-to-be-in-12853969.php) found that in Texas, black prisoners are much more likely to be sent to solitary confinement, even as Texas prisons are phasing out the practice.

● In surveying the research on the topic, [the Sentencing Project estimates](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Black-Lives-Matter.pdf) that 61 to 80 percent of black overrepresentation in prisons can be explained by higher crime rates in the black population. (Of course, those higher crime rates themselves could be due in part to racial bias.) The rest is probably because of racial bias.

● [The BJS](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/p11.pdf) found that African American males are 6 times more likely to be incarcerated than white males.

# **Drug War and Racism**
**Black people are consistently arrested, charged and convicted of drug crimes including possession, distribution and conspiracy at far higher rates than white people. This, despite research showing that both races use and sell drugs at about the same rate.**

**For more general data on the Drug War, see the [*Drug Decriminalization*](https://archive.ph/uY9Yr#h.wjr6ndv9vk09) section.**

● [A 2014 ACLU survey of SWAT teams](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/jus14-warcomeshome-report-web-rel1.pdf) across the country found that “dynamic entry” and paramilitary police tactics are disproportionately used against black and Latino people. Most of these raids were on people suspected of low-level drug crimes.

○ While White & Black Americans **admit to using and selling illicit drugs at similar rates**, Black Americans are **VASTLY more likely to go to prison** for a drug offense.

○ In 2002, **Black Americans were incarcerated for drug offenses at TEN TIMES** the rate of White Americans.

○ Today, **Blacks are 3.7x as likely to be arrested for a marijuana offense** as Whites, **despite similar usage**.

○ **97% of “large-population counties”** have **racial biases** in their drug offense incarceration.

● [https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199004263221706](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199004263221706)

○ “During the six-month period in which we collected the urine samples, 133 women in Pinellas County were reported to health authorities after delivery for substance abuse during pregnancy. Despite the similar rates of substance abuse among black and white women in our study, black women were reported at approximately **10 times** the rate for white women (P<0.0001), and poor women were more likely than others to be reported. We conclude that the use of illicit drugs is common among pregnant women regardless of race and socioeconomic status. If legally mandated reporting is to be free of racial or economic bias, it must be based on objective medical criteria”

● In contrast to the assertion that blacks are more likely to be arrested because they’re more likely to use drugs in public, [a 2002 study of narcotics search warrants in the San Diego area](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/faculty.cwsl.edu/benner/aaRacialDisparityinNarcoticsSearchWarrants.pdf) — that is, warrants to search for drugs in private homes — found that black and Hispanic residents were “significantly over-represented as targets of narcotics search warrants,” even after adjusting for usage rates. The study also found that “searches of White suspects were more successful in recovering the targeted drug than were searches of either Black or Hispanic suspects.”

● [Mitchell 2015](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Examining-Racial-Disparities-in-Drug-Arrests-Mitchell-Caudy/6525c61ac61bf2952f7d04138faf488abd86774a)

○ High numbers of African American arrests and charges of possession show that although most drug users in the United States are white, black people are the largest group being targeted as the root of the problem. It also concluded that minorities have been disproportionately arrested for drug offenses and the difference could not "be explained by differences in drug offending, non-drug offending, or residing in the kinds of neighborhoods likely to have heavy police emphasis on drug offending."

● [A study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2561263/pdf/nihms48329.pdf) by Andrew Golub, Bruce Johnson, and Eloise Dunlap affirms the racial divide in drug arrests, notably marijuana arrests, where black people with no prior arrests (0.9%) or one prior arrest (4.3%) were nearly twice as likely to be sentenced to jail as their white counterparts (0.4% and 2.3%, respectively).

● Nationwide African-Americans were sent to state prisons for drug offenses [13](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.hrw.org/legacy/campaigns/drugs/war/key-facts.htm) [times](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2518612/pdf/0980176.pdf) more often than other races, even though they only comprised [13%](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/store/products/the-celling-of-america-an-inside-look-at-the-us-prison-industry/) of regular drug users.

○ They make up 35% of drug arrests, 55% of convictions, and 74% of people sent to prison for drug possession crimes.

● [A 2008 paper](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2518612/pdf/0980176.pdf) stated that drug use rates by black people (7.4%) were comparable to those by whites (7.2%), and since there are far more white people than black people, 72% of illegal drug users in America are white, and only 15% are black.

● [By the end of the Bush presidency](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://biotech.law.lsu.edu/crs/RL32824.pdf), 9.18% of all black people in the United States were in prison, on probation, or on parole, but only 1.76% of the white population in the United States were in one of those situations. In 1993, there were 6 times as many black Americans in local jails per 100,000 inmates as there were white Americans. From 1989, when Bush took office, to 1993, when he left, the number of black males in American prisons increased by 300,000 people. The number of white males increased by 50,000 inmates. The number of sentences for drugs increased from 25,309 in 1989 to 48,554 in 1993.

● According to Michelle Alexander, the author of [The New Jim Crow](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://books.google.com/books/about/The_New_Jim_Crow.html?id=_SKbzXqmawoC) and a professor of law at Stanford Law School, drug trading is done at similar rates all over the US, but most people arrested for it are colored. Together, blacks and Hispanics were 58% of all prisoners in 2008 but only one quarter of the US population. Most prisoners are arrested for drug related crime, and in at least 15 states, three quarters of them are black or Latino.

● [A 2006 study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-9125.2006.00044.x) ([non-paywall](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.thestranger.com/images/blogimages/2010/10/28/1288284332-beckett_criminology__race__drugs_and_policing.pdf)) concluded that black people were significantly overrepresented for those arrested for drug delivery offenses in Seattle. It also found that it was a result of law enforcement focusing on crack offenders and outdoor venues and dedicating resources to racially-heterogeneous neighborhoods.

● [A 2012 study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3477985/pdf/AJPH.2012.300699.pdf) found that black youths were less likely than white youths to use or sell drugs but more likely to be arrested for doing so.

● [The ACLU](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.aclu-ia.org/en/press-releases/iowa-ranks-among-worst-states-racial-disparities-marijuana-arrests) found that Iowa had the highest racial disparity of the fifty states.

○ Black people in Iowa were arrested for marijuana possession at a rate 8.4 times higher than whites.

○ Black people are 7.3 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana compared to white people despite similar usage.

● According to figures from the National Registry of Exonerations (NER) black people are [about five times more likely](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Documents/Race_and_Wrongful_Convictions.pdf) to go to prison for drug possession than white people. According to exoneration data, black people are also 12 times more likely to be wrongly convicted of drug crimes.

○ This study also gives details on wrongful conviction of blacks in general, talking about a number of crimes

● When Harris County, Tex., saw a flaw in how drug testing was conducted at its crime lab, officials went back and exonerated dozens of people who had been wrongly convicted for possession — most pleaded guilty, despite their innocence. This is because prosecutors often promise harsher sentences or more charges for defendants who take a case to trial. Black people comprise 20 percent of the Harris County population but made up [62 percent of the wrongful drug convictions.](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.texastribune.org/2017/03/07/report/)

● Not included in these wrongful conviction figures are cases in which police and narcotics task forces conducted mass arrests of entire black or Latino neighborhoods or towns. Hundreds of people were persuaded to plead guilty to drug charges. [By the NER’s estimate](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Documents/Race_and_Wrongful_Convictions.pdf), there have been more than 1,800 such “group exonerations” in 15 cities since 1989. Almost all those exonerated were black or Latino.

● [A 2017 report](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/projects.heraldtribune.com/one-war-two-races/punishment) by the Sarasota Herald-Tribune of Florida’s drug convictions found that while blacks made up 17 percent of the state’s population, they made up 46 percent of felony drug convictions since 2004. Blacks were also three times as likely to get hit with — and made up two-thirds of — the sentencing enhancements for committing drug crimes near a school zone, church, park or public housing. In all, when blacks and whites committed similar drug crimes, blacks on average received a sentence that was two-thirds longer. In some parts of the state, it was [two or three times longer](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://web.archive.org/web/20200614145618/http://projects.heraldtribune.com/bias/bauer/).

● [An analysis](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.vera.org/downloads/publications/for-the-record-unjust-burden-racial-disparities.pdf) of drug war data by the Vera Institute of Justice published found that “the risk of incarceration in the federal system for someone who uses drugs monthly and is black is more than seven times that of his or her white counterpart.”

● [A 2000 study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022427800037002003) found that the disproportionality of black drug offenders in Pennsylvania prisons was unexplained by higher arrest rates, which suggested the possibility of operative discrimination in sentencing.

● [A 2017 report](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://reason.com/2017/06/13/poor-neighborhoods-hit-hardest-by-asset/) of civil asset forfeiture seizures in Chicago showed that the vast majority of such actions were in poor, predominantly black neighborhoods.

○ The war on drugs is overtly racist -- Nixon’s domestic policy chief explains it himself

○ *“The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I’m saying. We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.”* ~ John Ehrlichman, President Richard Nixon’s domestic policy chief

● [BJS Racial Disparity in U.S. Drug Arrests](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=4200)

○ Since black people constituted 40% of drug violation arrests but only 13% of admitted drug users. There was an apparent disparity of 27%, analytically refined to 23%.

○ Further analysis indicated 10% of the 23% were attributable to race-neutral factors, but the analysis could not explain the remaining 13%.

○ 16% of those who sold drugs were black, but 49% of those arrested for doing so were black.

○ Between 1986 and 1997, the number of federal drug prisoners quintupled, with 74% of those minorities convicted of low-level drug offenses and sentenced under mandatory minimum laws and later added conspiracy amendments to the law.

● [A 1992 study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/search) found that mandatory minimum sentencing caused blacks and Hispanics to receive more-severe sentences than their white counterparts from 1984 to 1990.

● Professor Cathy Schnieder of International Service at American University [did a study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2307/2658075) and noted that in 1989, black people, representing 12-15% of all drug use in the United States, made up 41% of all arrests. That was a noted increase from 38% in 1988. White people were 47% of those in state-funded treatment centers but fewer than 10% of those committed to prison.

● **People like John P. Walters have [criticized](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1157&context=uclf) the Drug War and Racism though.**

**CLAIM: There was support from black institutions and groups like the black caucus who deliberately exacerbated tough-on-crime.**

That is correct. The fact that there were Black people who supported "getting tough on crime" is not ignored in the relevant literature establishing structural and institutional racism, and has been part of broader analyses. For illustration, in her book [The New Jim Crow](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Jim_Crow), Michelle Alexander explicitly remarks that some members of the Congressional Black Caucus believed the harsh penalties passed with the Anti-Drug Abuse Act were needed, while others were convinced that the new legislation was biased against African Americans. She also takes the time to discuss Black support for tough-on-crime policies. The following summarizes one of her main points on the matter:

“Regardless, the reality for poor blacks trapped in ghettos remains the same: they must live in a state of perpetual insecurity and fear. It is perfectly understandable, then, that some African Americans would be complicit with the system of mass incarceration, even if they oppose, as a matter of social policy, the creation of racially isolated ghettos and the subsequent transfer of black youth from underfunded, crumbling schools to brand-new, hightech prisons. In the era of mass incarceration, poor African Americans are not given the option of great schools, community investment, and job training. Instead, they are offered police and prisons. If the only choice that is offered blacks is rampant crime or more prisons, the predictable (and understandable) answer will be ‘more prisons.’”

Also see the National Research Council's report on The Growth of Incarceration in the United States:

“On the other hand, new research also finds that some black leaders supported tougher laws, most notably in the early years of the war on drugs, while others were fierce opponents. The growing concentration of violence, drug addiction, and open-air drug markets in poor urban neighborhoods; disillusionment with government efforts to stem these developments; and widening class divisions among blacks help explain why some African American community leaders endorsed a causal story of the urban crisis that focused on individual flaws, not structural problems, and that singled out addicts and drug pushers as part of the “undeserving poor” who posed the primary threat to working- and middle-class African Americans (Fortner, 2013; Barker, 2009, p. 151; Gottschalk, forthcoming; Cohen, 1999; Dawson, 2011).”

“Other black leaders endorsed what Forman (2012) describes as an “all-of-the-above” approach, calling for tougher sanctions and aggressive law enforcement but also for greater attention and resources to address underlying social and economic conditions. According to Forman, this helps explain why African American political, religious, and other leaders in Washington, DC, the only black-majority jurisdiction that controlled its sentencing policies (after home rule was granted in 1973), supported tougher crime policy. Opposition to these policies remained muted, even after their disproportionate toll on blacks, especially young black men, became apparent. Forman (2012) attributes this stance to the stigmatizing and marginalizing effects that contact with criminal justice had on former prisoners and their families, inhibiting them from taking public positions or engaging in political debates about these policies. Black leaders, politicians, and advocacy groups clearly were not the main instigators of the shift to harsh crime policy, but at least in some instances, their actions helped foster this turn, in many cases unwittingly.”

It is a complex topic which requires adopting systems lenses. I would keep in mind that structural and institutional racism does not require Black Americans (and other racialized minorities) to be purely passive to exist, and that they exist within the system being described.

# **Additional Studies**
● According to [a 2014 study by the Vera Institute of Justice](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/247227.pdf), black and Latino defendants in New York City were more likely to be detained before trial for comparable crimes. They were also more likely to have charges dismissed. The study didn’t look at this, but that may have been because they were more likely to be wrongly arrested in the first place. The study found that race played a role at nearly every step in the process, from arrest to detention to setting bail to sentencing.

● [A 2011 study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1990324) of bail in five large U.S. counties found that blacks received $7,000 higher bail than whites for violent crimes, $13,000 higher for drug crimes and $10,000 higher for crimes related to public order. These disparities were calculated after adjusting for the seriousness of the crime, criminal history and other variables.

● [A 2013 review](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.nyujlpp.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Jones-Give-Us-Free-16nyujlpp919.pdf) of 50 years of studies on racial disparities in bail practices found that black people are subject to pretrial detention more frequently, and have bail set at higher amounts, than white people who have similar criminal histories and are facing similar charges. Studies documented this disparity in state and federal cases as well as juvenile justice proceedings, and in all regions of the country.

After adjusting for criminal history, seriousness of the crime and other factors, the study found that black people were 18 to 39 percent more likely than white people to have their probation revoked.

**CLAIM: Black Lives Matter? No, All Lives Matter.**

The typical responses to this are already well-known and basically impenetrable. For example:

“Save the rainforests.”

“No… save all forests.”

Clearly, forests in general are important. But rainforests face unique circumstances that are not applicable to other types of forests. In other words, it is useful to be precise about specific problems facing specific communities.

As a response to the claim that “black lives matter,” the claim that “all lives matter” violates pragmatic appropriateness criteria: it confuses listeners about the issue (Maxim of Quality); it is, at best, irrelevant to the topic-at-hand (Maxim of Relation): and it introduces ambiguity and obscurity into the discussion (Maxim of Manner). It is not false that all lives matter, but so what? Our goal in speaking and writing is not merely to say all and only true things; we’re not simply computers that check the truth of a sentence and then spit out that sentence if it passes the truth-test. The broad context of speech is very important to the appropriateness of that speech, and “all lives matter” at this moment, in this country, as a response to the claim that “black lives matter” fails the relevant pragmatic tests. So as the poster says, at this moment, in this country: all lives can’t matter until black lives matter.

**Shorter Version:**

It is not false that black lives matter. It is also not false that all lives matter. Saying that black lives matter is not saying that only black lives matter. And if all lives matter, then black lives, which are a proper subset of all lives, also matter. So why do some people respond to the claim that “black lives matter” by saying that “all lives matter,” and why do people told that “all lives matter” after they have said that “black lives matter” take the claim that “all lives matter” to be a negation of or a challenge to the claim that “black lives matter”? The central issue is one that lies in the linguistic distinction between what’s known as “semantic content” and “pragmatic content.” In brief, the “all lives matter” crowd is (intentionally or unintentionally violating criteria of pragmatic appropriateness and then defending that violation by appealing to unviolated criteria of semantic appropriateness.

**CLAIM: BLM is a terrorist organization.**

Black Lives Matter is not a terrorist organization nor a terrorist movement, and no responsible source would describe it as such.

\1. The State Department keeps a list of foreign groups that have been formally designated terrorist organizations. Black Lives Matter, a domestic organization, is not on it.

\2. There is no legal process for designating domestic groups as terrorist organizations.

\3. Black Lives Matter is not listed as a perpetrator group in a global database of nearly 200,000 terrorism incidents.

**CLAIM: BLM protests are violent/destructive.**

● Only 6 to 7% of BLM protests turned violent or destructive, and that was largely due to white supremacists, police, and counter protesters.

○ 38 of the protests that were considered violent were the toppling of confederate statues.

○ There were 50 car ramming attacks of people hating BLM so much they wanted to run their cars into people.

○ Over 100 of the events in which non-state actors engaged in the demonstrations, including the KKK, the Proud Boys, and the Boogaloo Boys.

○ In 30 of the events, counter protesters engaged with BLM protesters.

○ 90 of the events, militarized police actually instigated the violence.

○ Approximately 94% of all pro-BLM demonstrations have been peaceful, with 6% involving reports of violence, clashes with police, vandalism, looting, or other destructive activity.

■ In the remaining 6%, it is not clear who instigated the violent or destructive activity. While some cases of violence or looting have been provoked by demonstrators, other events have escalated as a result of aggressive government action, intervention from right-wing groups or individual assailants, and car-ramming attacks.

○ In contrast, demonstrations involving right-wing militias or militant social movements have turned violent or destructive over twice as often, or nearly 14% of the time.

○ Authorities are three times more likely to intervene in pro-BLM demonstrations than they are in other demonstrations.

■ When intervening, they are more likely to use force against pro-BLM demonstrators: 52% of the time, compared to 26% of the time against all other demonstrators.

○ These trends hold whether demonstrations have remained peaceful or not: authorities have engaged non-violent protests associated with BLM more than twice as often as other types of non-violent protests.

■ When intervening, authorities have used force 37% of the time against peaceful pro-BLM protesters, compared to under 20% of the time against other peaceful protesters.

○ At least 38 distinct, named far-right groups have engaged directly with pro-BLM demonstrators.

■ Approximately 26% of these demonstrations have turned violent or destructive.

○ The ‘Back the Blue’ movement has played a key role in the right-wing response to BLM, organizing counter-demonstrations as well as holding independent rallies in support of the police.

■ Nearly two-thirds of all ‘Back the Blue’ demonstrations are one-sided events, with no intervention by authorities. The lack of government engagement in pro-police demonstrations underlines a vast discrepancy in police response: 2% of pro-police demonstrations have been met with law enforcement intervention, relative to over 9% of pro-BLM demonstrations.

○ Car rammings are eight times more common at demonstrations associated with the BLM movement than at other types of demonstrations, with incidents reported at nearly 1% of all BLM-related events.

○ The vast majority — 73% — of all BLM-related demonstrations that faced car-ramming attacks were peaceful.

**CLAIM: What About Black-on-Black Crime?**

The main purpose of this argument is to dismiss the significance of police killings. You might hear this argument in its most common form: "If Black Lives Matter, you should support the police because of all the Black-on-Black crime." This is a racist dog whistle. To state that Black-on-Black crime alone is a problem paints a misleading picture that Black people are slaughtering their own in the streets, necessitating the role of the police to restore order.

There are three main problems with this argument:

\1. It's a red herring/tu quoque. There is no reason why we shouldn't believe that both are bad. We can both condemn police brutality and misconduct while condemning murders, theft, and etc. by the civilian population. Civilians can and will commit crimes, including murder. Police are supposed to uphold the law, and as such should be held to a higher standard when they make mistakes or commit crimes.

\2. The reason why there is Black-on-Black crime is the same reason why there is a lot of White-on-White crime; [the vast majority of crime occurs within racial groups](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/leonard-pitts-jr/article4187602.html). This is a byproduct of systemic racism since poverty, proximity, urbanity, etc cause crime.

\3. This argument frames the advocacy of BLM (no police brutality) and the suppression of Black-on-Black crime as a trade-off. There is no reason to believe that police murdering Black people would lower Black-on-Black crime. This trade-off makes absolutely no sense.

The comparison is apples and oranges. If a black person kills a black person, they are going to jail. When a police officer kills an unarmed black person, it is usually done with impunity. The cop gets paid leave and comes back free. A police officer is an agent of the state, a public servant, a position which necessitates a higher standard of accountability to the public than a civilian.

**CLAIM: BLM wants to disrupt the nuclear family.**

This doesn’t fully represent what the Black Lives Matter website says about families. "We disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure requirement by supporting each other as extended families and ‘villages’ that collectively care for one another, especially our children, to the degree that mothers, parents, and children are comfortable," it says on the page titled "What we believe." It also says “We make our spaces family-friendly and enable parents to fully participate with their children. We dismantle the patriarchal practice that requires mothers to work ‘double shifts’ so that they can mother in private even as they participate in public justice work."

● "I don't think there's any reasonable basis to claim" that the group’s website "is promoting an actual reduction in the proportion of people actually living in a Western nuclear family structure — but rather, to imagine ‘successful’ families as more inclusive than this particular vision of family," - Davin L. Phoenix, a University of California, Irvine, political scientist who studies Black politics. Phoenix said that the statement calling for "disruption" is most accurately interpreted as disrupting agendas that give benefits to people with middle-class family structures over those without. For example, zoning laws that prioritize single-family housing or tax credits for married homeowners leave out people who are single or rent their home."It is a call to disrupt the notion that the nuclear family structure is the only way to ensure neighborhood stability and vitality, and to affirm that neighborhoods that contain a high volume of non-traditional family structures (e.g. households with a single parent or grandparents / other familial figures as primary caregivers for kids) are just as capable of — and just as deserving of — policies and practices that contribute to neighborhood stability and vitality," - Phoenix.

● Black Lives Matter has essentially said the nuclear family is untenable and that extended families provide the necessary support to take care of one another. - Nadia Brown, a political science and African American studies professor at Purdue University. "For example, if both parents work outside the home and a child gets sick, who will care for the child while also earning an income? Having a grandparent or another adult in the home who assists with care responsibilities lessens the burdens on the parents to both work and care for the children."

● BLM "is focused on improving life outcomes and opportunities for Black-identifying people in the United States, regardless of sexual orientation," - Georgetown University government professor Jamil Scott, whose specialties include race and ethnicity in politics. “Across online materials that I’ve encountered, associated with Black Lives Matters and its chapters, I’ve never seen any statements that indicate Black Lives Matter is calling for the destruction of the nuclear family."

**CLAIM: BLM money just goes to democrat candidates.**

Black Lives Matter money goes to ActBlue which is a nonprofit technology organization that provides a platform for people to contribute to Democratic campaigns and causes. Black Lives Matter and Democratic presidential candidates both use the platform to fundraise. ActBlue does not pocket donations that are facilitated by its platform — it ferries the money along to the organizations requesting it. It’s similar to a platform called WinRed, which facilitates fundraising for Republican candidates. [https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jun/12/ryan-fournier/conservative-pundits-share-false-claim-about-black/](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jun/12/ryan-fournier/conservative-pundits-share-false-claim-about-black/) [https://www.factcheck.org/2020/06/donations-to-black-lives-matter-group-dont-go-to-dnc/](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.factcheck.org/2020/06/donations-to-black-lives-matter-group-dont-go-to-dnc/) [https://apnews.com/article/archive-fact-checking-9043930562](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://apnews.com/article/archive-fact-checking-9043930562) 

**CLAIM: More White people die from the police than Black people.**

To say more White people are killed by police completely ignores marginal distribution, conditional distribution, and bayesian data analysis.

\1. Despite making 13% of the population,  Black people were the victims of more than 28% of police killings. They are 2.5 times more likely to be killed in general. The reason why more white people are killed is because white people make up the larger population.

\2. Northeastern professor Matt Miller ran a statistical analysis, categorizing police violence into various categories (e.g. victim unarmed, victim possessed a knife, victim possessed a gun). He found that, in every subcategory of police violence, Black people were killed at a significantly higher rate. Among those who were unarmed and appeared to show no objective threat to police, nearly 2/3 of those killed were Black.

**CLAIM: George Floyd died of a drug overdose.**

Mr. Floyd had "19 nanograms per milliliter of methamphetamine and 2.9 nanograms per milliliter of THC, the major psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. Those numbers suggest he hadn't used them in at least several hours, maybe a day." Floyd "also had 11

nanograms of fentanyl in his blood. That number, in and of itself, doesn't tell us much. Immediately after  person dies, the blood concentration of fentanyl increases significantly, so knowing only the post-mortem amount does not tell us about Mr. Floyd's level of intoxication before his death.” "The findings of the two autopsy reports - one from the Hennepin County medical examiner's office and the other from a medical examiner hired by Mr. Floyd's family classified the manner of Mr. Floyd's death as

homicide."

**CLAIM: George Floyd beat women and held guns to their pregnant bellies.**

The Associated Press detailed that in 2007, Floyd was involved in an aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon, in which he and five other suspects forced their way into a woman’s apartment. Floyd was identified as the suspect that pushed a pistol against the abdomen of the woman, who was identified in other reports as Aracely Henriquez. He pleaded guilty to the crime in 2009 and served five years in prison before his release in 2013. However, there is no evidence that Henriquez was pregnant at the time of the robbery, according to court documents. The documents further state that after Floyd put the gun to her abdomen, he went on to search the house while another suspect guarded her. It was this suspect that beat Henriquez, not Floyd. [https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jul/08/facebook-posts/evidence-shows-george-floyds-death-was-not-result-/](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jul/08/facebook-posts/evidence-shows-george-floyds-death-was-not-result-/) [https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jun/16/instagram-posts/no-photo-doesnt-show-woman-george-floyd-allegedly-/](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jun/16/instagram-posts/no-photo-doesnt-show-woman-george-floyd-allegedly-/)

Regardless of the specific details at play, people only bring up this point as a red herring. Floyd’s involvement in the robbery, although morally reprehensible, did not justify Derek Chauvin killing Floyd over a decade later, especially as Floyd *had already served his time in prison* for the robbery. The reason George Floyd is relevant to the national conversation at all is because he was murdered by Derek Chauvin, and the immediate situation around his murder is completely unrelated to the robbery in 2007. The point here is that Floyd’s robbery involvement in 2007 does NOT justify the extrajudicial police brutality that he faced in 2020, nor does it justify any other instances of police brutality/discrimination against black people.

**CLAIM: Not all cops are bastards (AKA “a few bad apples”)**

ACAB is a statement on how every individual cop is ultimately complicit in the atrocities of police. If you stand rank-and-file with other officers and reluctantly watch as your friend launches tear gas into a crowd of peaceful protesters, you are a bastard. As the saying goes, if there are 10 bad cops in a police force of a 1000 “good cops” but the bad cops aren’t held accountable, then there are just 1000 bad cops.

According to [Roberta Johnson’s paper on Whistleblowing and the Police](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://rutgerspolicyjournal.org/sites/jlpp/files/Johnson_Whistleblowing.pdf), "Penalties for whistleblowers can be harsh. ‘The full force of the agency, formal and informal, is brought to bear on the ‘snitcher.’ Rats are scorned, shunned, excluded, condemned, harassed, and almost invariably, cast out. Noback-up for them. They literally find cheese in their lockers.’” Whistleblowers end up on “end up on a ‘hit list’ that can result in unwanted transfers, a dock in pay, unfavorable assignments and other retaliatory measures. Case after case offers evidence of harsh retaliation.”

The failure of police to reform itself by firing and cracking down on whistleblowers indicates that even if a good person enters the police force, they will either be booted out for trying to snitch on their peers or will be peer-pressured to be complicit. If an individual cannot avoid complicity in the misconduct of operations, the only ethical option is to quit.

Cops occupy a similar space to soldiers who fight on the immoral side of a war. For example, every soldier who voluntarily served in the Confederate military was complicit in fighting for slavery. Every person who served the Confederacy was ultimately complicit in a war crime, whether through serving in combat or logistics. I bet that there were some really kind and well-intentioned Confederate soldiers who wanted to honorably serve their state or defend their homes. At the end of the day, their intentions do not matter because they fought for a bastard cause. In a similar vein, the role of police in society is to use violence and intimidation to maintain the current order, whether through stop and frisk, evicting families during a pandemic, or suppressing what are largely peaceful protests with tear gas and rubber bullets. The current order is unjust and that’s why ACAB.

Moving into the empirical realm, the vast majority of police officers have either committed, or covered up, at least one instance of police misconduct. [According to a study from the US Department of Justice](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/181312.pdf) (based on survey data from police officers themselves):

● 84% of police witnessed fellow officers using more force than necessary.

● 61% of cops "do not always report even serious criminal violations that involve the abuse of authority by fellow officers."

● 52% of cops believed that "It is not unusual for officers to ignore improper conduct by their fellow officers."

● A strong majority of cops allow their fellow officers to get away with misconduct, and believe that others do it as well. This is indicative of a culture of abuse within police departments

● The use of force by police is very often improper; according to the DOJ, "improper force was used in 38 percent of encounters that involved force." More than one-third of all police uses of force are "improper," and those are just the ones that we know about!

[https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/topic-pages/clearances](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/topic-pages/clearances)

● These are the 2017 crime clearance rates for US law enforcement officials, from data released voluntarily by police departments

● There are three conditions that must be met for a crime to be cleared. arrest, charges pressed, and the case is turned over to prosecution. OR it can be cleared by exceptional means, the conditions of which include the following. Identified offender, sufficient evidence for arrest, and some uncontrollable circumstance that prevented the arrest, charging and prosecution of an offender.

● Given these caveats, these are the clearance rates for law enforcement

○ Murder and non-negligent manslaughter 61.7%

○ Rape 34.5%

○ Robbery 29.7

○ Aggravated assault 53.3%

○ Burglary 13.5%

○ Larceny-theft 19.2%

○ Motor vehicle theft 13.7%

● These clearance rates show that law enforcement is not only unduly violent, but they also fail to put serious offenders behind bars. They are violating the human rights of the citizenry and still can't find criminals.

**CLAIM: A police officer is 18.5 times more likely to be shot by a black man, than an unarmed black man is to be shot by a cop.**

This statistic is both misleading and a red herring. It might seem scary at first, until you realize that unarmed civilians obviously outnumber cops for all races. [The exact same method could be applied to white men rather than black men and you’d get 77x instead of 18.5x](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/06/how-conservatives-use-made-up-nonsense-to-justify-police-killings/), but we can probably all recognize that white people aren’t some big threat to police - and we should recognize the same regarding blacks. Regardless, this statistic does nothing to help point out problems with the black community or the sort, and only serves to justify police killings of black people.

**CLAIM: Police have a very dangerous job, which justifies them being able to use force even in cases when it’s unjustified.**

Law enforcement is not a particularly dangerous profession. [According to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-dangerous-is-police-w_b_6373798), delivery and truck drivers are about twice as likely to die on the job compared to police. Fishers and logging workers are about ten times as likely to die at work as are police officers.

In addition, [according to figures from the FBI](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-2012-statistics-on-law-enforcement-officers-killed-and-assaulted), many cops killed on the job die from accidents (such as traffic fatalities), not from homicide. The murder rate for police (3 per 100,000) is significantly lower than that for the general population (5 per 100,000). Keep in mind though that police are more likely than other jobs to die from a shooting, but this level of danger isn’t reflected in overall death stats for the job.

On top of this, the most dangerous part of the polices’ job, dealing with violent crime, is what people usually think of when they bring up how dangerous the job is; however, [dealing with any violent crimes only makes up about 4% of their overall duties](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/upshot/unrest-police-time-violent-crime.html) (so around an hour and a half per week assuming a 40 hour work week).

**CLAIM: Less than 1% of all police contact with civilians results in police brutality or death by a cop.**

Specifically, 5.2% of African Americans were likely to experience threat or excessive force from police. That’s compared to 2.4% for White Americans. Let’s also take into account that 3.1% of the traffic stops against black drivers, police did not have a legitimate reason to stop them. That’s comparable to the 1.8% of white traffic stops for zero legitimate reason (also bringing up the “black on black” crime statistic is irrelevant because these are illegitimate reasons.) Neglecting the fact that 40% of families experience domestic violence from police. Government sources project that nearly 1 in 4.7 officers have committed police brutality in their lifetimes (~20%). UsaToday found police misconduct in 85,000 cops nationwide comparable to the 800,000 cops there are in the nation (~10%). For excessive force, African Americans are more likely to have statistics that back them. The majority of those who experience force, 84% perceive it to be excessive as did those who were pushed, grabbed, hit, or kicked. What is perceived as excessive force? An unjust reaction to a call. For example, 89.5% of the population believed the police behaved respectfully. Only 59.5% think that they improved the situation.

● **Police Interactions**

○ “Police interactions” and “police contact” aren’t arguments. “Police interactions” can be “peaceful”, however let’s not forget that police interactions can range from shooting a guy in the back of the head to saying “hi” to someone. Police interactions are always going to be high because a police interaction can just be greeting a cop. What is a “contact”? A domestic violence call? A traffic stop? In any case, making such a huge claim about a lack of racial bias among police owes some clarity and specificity. More importantly, the bigger problem here, of course, is that so many interactions between black people and the police simply aren’t reported and never make the news. The validity of an interaction isn’t expressed or valid and police interactions are going to be endless so it causes inflation of numbers.

● **Arrests**

○ Arrests are skewed. A 2 year study of 3 middle of the road police departments.  Main take is that "The results reveal 893 UOF incidents, representing a UOF rate of 0.086% of 1,041,737 calls for service (1 in 1167) and 0.78% of 114,064 criminal arrests (1 in 128)." (UOF = Use of force.) That means 10 million arrests is about 100 million calls for service.  Extrapolating the math puts us at roughly 78,125 uses of force during arrests. Interesting side note, 76% of hospitalizations were unrelated to the use of force of the officers. [https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=273714](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=273714)

● **Lightning comparison**

○ Anybody of any race can get hit by lightning. It is more likely that 320 million people would get hit by lightning, more than 13% of the population getting killed by police. The numbers are still disproportionate because more black people get killed by police per capita than the people in the US get struck by lightning. Also the lighting doesn’t care who it strikes. It doesn’t have feelings. It doesn’t make decisions. The lightning didn’t have 6 months of training.

● A different conclusion is apparent when a population-level perspective is taken. That approach aims to identify all such deaths in a population and reflects not only the outcomes of police encounters, the focus of Fryer’s investigation,1 but also the likelihood of police encounters. That difference matters.

● Seven studies discussing police bias and the variations in their findings were analyzed.

● These variations in findings could reflect variation in the actual phenomenon across agencies and/or geographic areas or could reflect different research methods used to study the same phenomenon.

■ Fryer utilizes several datasets to analyze Police Use of Force:

● A close look at the coding does not answer the concerning question raised by these variable definitions: Why are officers attacking when only defensive resistance is being used by the subject? These definitions raise questions about the validity of the study.

● Fryer summarizes his findings by reporting that he found racial differences in incidents involving non-lethal force, but no racial differences in officer-involved shootings […] One cannot compare less-lethal force used within NYC stop and frisk encounters to Houston OIS’s and draw conclusions about how less lethal force and lethal force might be similar or different in terms of racial bias.

■ [Resolution of apparent paradoxes in the race-specific frequency of use-of-force by police](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-018-0110-z)

● Argues that the indication that there are no racial disparities in officer involved shootings are explainable are explainable under a generative model. The paper asserts that this model is inaccurate, and that Population-level measures of use-of-force by police are more robust indicators of the overall severity of racial disparities than encounter-conditional measures—since the later neglect the differential morbidity and mortality arising from differential encounter rates.

● In more technical terms, statistical assessments of racial disparities conditioned on problematic intermediate variables, such as encounters, which might themselves be a causal outcome of racial bias, can produce misleading inferences.

Cesario just says that racial differences in encounter rates can differ between black and white unarmed non criminals. However using this encounter denominator is just guilty of collider bias. If there’s bias in who gets stopped in the first place, then looking at discrepancies in the resulting interactions won’t give you the full picture.

○ **Used to argue police are less hesitant to kill black people and that the biases should correlate with the real world.**

○ But the county of officers in which the study took place also disproportionately kills African Americans, 2% of pop. but ~15% of all police shootings are deaths. The study was a simulation and didn’t take actual data from police. It lacks ecological validity. That is, when you observe people their behavior tends to change (this is called the Hawthorne effect. Essentially it means that because the police are being watched and they know they are being researched they may alter their behavior to be consistent with how they want to be viewed.). Considering that this paper's findings are inconsistent with real world statistics, I would say that it is not representative of real cop behavior. A more accurate [Harvard study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0229686) found that black people are actually more than 3 times more likely to be killed during a police encounter. [Other studies](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/03/us/minneapolis-police-use-of-force.html) have shown black people experience police use of force. In my opinion, I'm not sure what this study is attempting to prove? In an argument on police racism I would never make a claim for something that is so hard to prove with little evidence. This study also has many limitations in its way of acting it out; this study exists solely in the confines of research labs. It is an empirical fact that unarmed black men are killed at a higher rate than white men per capita and by proportion. The speed at which they are killed is an irrelevant variable to me.

○ This means that the 'black names' used were Chloe Washington and Ryan Jefferson, while the 'white names' were Megan Anderson or Bryan Thompson, which I feel you couldn't tell the difference between races.

○ It's also a cherry picked study. [A meta analysis](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/09/11/1706255114.full) that looked at 24 studies looking at racial differences in hiring from 1989 to 2016 found not only is there a very significant gap between black and white callbacks (36%), there also hasn't been a significant change during that time. Applicant education, applicant gender, study method, occupational groups, and local labor market conditions were all adjusted for, and there was still no significant change.

○ **Used to argue the disparity in denial rates in mortgage lending was wholly attributed to other factors.**

○ It actually says “The results of this study indicate that minority applicants, on average, do have greater debt burdens, higher loan-to-value ratios, and weaker credit histories and they are less likely to buy single-family homes than white applicants, and that these disadvantages do account for a large portion of the difference in denial rates, reducing the disparity between minority and white denials from the originally reported ratio of 2.7 to 1 to roughly 1.6 to 1. But these factors do not wholly eliminate the disparity, since the adjusted ratio implies that even after controlling for financial, employment, and neighborhood characteristics, black and Hispanic mortgage applicants in the Boston metropolitan area are roughly 60 percent more likely to be turned down than whites. This discrepancy means that minority applicants with the same economic and property characteristics as white applicants would experience a denial rate of 17 percent rather than the actual white denial rate of 11 percent. Thus, in the end, a statistically significant gap remains, which is associated with race."

● [Pratt 1998](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047235298000282)

○ **Used to argue that the racial gap in sentencing is statistically insignificant.**

○ Pratt says “see Zatz, 1987). According to the above analysis, the estimated effect size of race on sentencing decisions does not approach the magnitude of those associated with the legally relevant variables (primarily the seriousness of the offense). At this level of aggregation, however, the race effect is diluted by differences in the operationalization techniques by various researchers. Isolating the methodological differences in racial classification approaches illustrates how the effect of race on sentencing outcomes may be concealed. Given this condition, it then becomes necessary.” So apparently the whole point of Pratt is that legal considerations are relevant to sentencing, but the disparity that still remains represents thousands of people treated unfairly by the system.

○ Pratt 1998 seems ineligible because of no empirical analyses. Pratt says the race variable is statistically insignificant when controlling for offense severity however he only analyzed data from the 60s, 70s, and 80s, but crime decreased in the 90s. So this paper is irrelevant.

○ [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10940-005-7362-7](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10940-005-7362-7)

○ Mitchell 2005 even addresses Pratt by doing a meta-analysis and finds race to be statistically significant.

○ First, unlike Pratt (1998), Mitchell reviews published and unpublished studies.

○ Second, Pratt’s research excluded discrete sentencing outcomes (e.g., incarceration decisions); in contrast, Mitchell synthesizes both continuous and discrete sentencing outcomes.

○ Third, and most importantly, the focus of Mitchell is on explaining why the findings of sentencing research vary so dramatically; an issue neglected in Pratt (1998).

○ **Used to argue Verbal IQ accounts for the racial gap in sentencing and arrests.**

○ The fundamental problem with Beaver 2013 is that the analysis was underpowered. The paper says based on NHST results that it finds no evidence of racial discrimination, but this is a type II error. Beaver et al (2013), only used a subsample of African American and White males and did not include any measures of disadvantage status. Beaver et al (2013) limited their study to comparisons between White and Black males. Race categories that do not include Hispanics can mask disparities between groups by inflating arrest and incarceration proportions among Whites and deflating the proportions among Black people. Expanding the race category to include Hispanics will avoid this. Prior research has clearly demonstrated the connection between criminal offending and socioeconomics and these variables may also be connected to criminal justice outcomes. Additionally their results aren’t aren’t as reliable because they use negative binomial regression. By using an extra parameter, their precision is decreased.

○ The problem with this study is it’s methodology with instrumental variables. In an effort to identify the relationship, they instrumented police levels with what they called ‘‘paid officers granted”. Paid officers granted was modeled as the sum of two federal community policing grant awards to local law enforcement agencies: (1) Universal Hiring Program (UHP) grants and (2) Distressed Neighborhood Program (DNP) grants. Their equation used to create the paid officers grant variable was as follows: ‘‘paid officers granted = 0.75 \* UHP hires + DNP hires”. First-stage regressions revealed strong associations between lagged paid officers granted and current-year police levels. That is, COPS grants significantly increased the sizes of the police departments included in their sample, although not to the degree the authors expected. Their approach to instrumenting police levels is based on the simple premise that hiring grants boost the size of police forces. Hiring is also unlikely to directly affect crime, except through police levels. The possibility remains, however, that some omitted variable is associated with hiring grants and crime (an example may be ‘‘progressiveness” in fact lots of variables are associated with the crime decrease in the 90s that they omitted). Additionally since they used a Just-Identified model, they couldn’t test for instrument validity nor relevance like an over-identified model could. Granted they did attempt to test for instrument relevance in table 4:

○ However there’s no specification is the result is statistically significant in the first stage regression? Even then

○ significance tests alone are not sufficient. This is because when instruments are only weakly correlated with the endogenous regressor, IV estimates of parameters will be biased in the same direction as OLS and estimated standard error will be unreliable. Specifically, standard errors will be too small and the null will be rejected too often. Staiger and Stock recommend conducting an F-test on the instruments in the first-stage regression; an F-statistic of at least 10, in their view, is indicative of relevance. Of course, if the first-stage regression indicates one instrument is irrelevant (i.e., not individually significant) the researcher should consider dropping the instrument as efficiency is not improved by its use. This study did not make use of that in fact their testing and results of instrument relevance seem poor ngl. They also didn’t properly test if not, didn’t test, for instrument validity. What they did was show no significant association between pre-COPS crime and paid officers granted. However this is invalid because (1) this approach may be limited without introducing controls for current crime and (2) this is not a formal test of instrument validity. In order to assess instrument validity, a model must be over-identified. Evans and Owens has only one instrument so their model is just-identified and the validity of the instruments cannot be tested. Evans and Owens combined two hiring grant programs (UHP and DNP) into a single measure of paid officers granted, again yielding a just-identified model yielding invalid instruments.

■ This meta analysis, which analyzed Evans and Owens along with other studies, found that although there is a small, inverse association between police levels and overall index crime, when this relationship is examined across individual crime types, the effect decreases in magnitude, loses statistical significance and, in some cases, changes direction.

**PRISONS AND CRIME**
# **Predictors of Crime**
**While there are a number of predictors of crime, there’s uncertainty as to what all of the predictors are and how impactful each one truly is. This is a complicated issue and needs a multi-faceted approach, not just something like “increase welfare” or “increase police”.**

The [Death Penalty Information Center](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/) provides a great collection of resources on the death penalty and etc if you want to take a look.**
## Not a Deterrent
To start off with [a bit from Amnesty International](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/48000/act500062008en.pdf) - “[The argument that death penalty deters crime] *supposes that criminals study and anticipate the consequences of getting caught, and decide that a long term of imprisonment is acceptable, whereas execution is not. Many crimes are committed on the spur-of-the-themoment, leaving little opportunity for potential punishments to influence whether the crime is committed in the first place as criminals do not believe they will be caught and held to account.* ... *Once criminals have knowingly committed a capital offence, they no longer have any interest in lessening their potential punishment by not committing further murders or other offences. For example, if armed robbery carries the death penalty, the robber loses nothing by committing murders while attempting to flee.*”

● [Do executions lower homicide rates?](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://files.deathpenaltyinfo.org/legacy/files/DeterrenceStudy2009.pdf)

○ Looks at the **opinions of leading criminologists on the topic of the death penalty detering murder**

○ 88.2%** of the respondents said no to the question: *“Do you feel that the death penalty acts as a deterrent to the commitment to murder—that it lowers the murder rate, or not?”*

○ In 1996, 83.6% said no to that question, so expert consensus has been consistent

● [NAS Death Penalty Deterrence Evaluation in 2012](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://files.deathpenaltyinfo.org/legacy/documents/NatResCouncil-Deterr.pdf)

○ A panel of the National Academy of Sciences unanimously concluded that there was **no credible evidence that the death penalty does or does not deter homicides**, mainly because **not enough research has been done** into the subject

○ Study in Hong Kong (who abolished the death penalty in the 90s) and Singapore (who increased use of it)

○ Finds no detectable effect on crime with use of death penalty

## Expensive Cost
[Studies from a number of states](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.amnestyusa.org/issues/death-penalty/death-penalty-facts/death-penalty-cost/) all come to the conclusion that the death penalty is more expensive compared to alternative routes, including costs being:

● 70% higher in Kansas

● 48% higher in Tennessee

● 3x higher in Maryland

● 12x higher in California

Similar results have been found in other states. [**This study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://scholarlycommons.susqu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1026&context=supr)**, which rounds up info from various other studies into *figure one***, finds that across the board cases which seek the death penalty cost more than those that do not:

|**The State**|**$ Seeking Death Penalty**|**$ Not Seeking Death Penalty**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
|Maryland|2,400,000|1,100,000|
|California|2,087,926|1,460,604|
|Connecticut|380,000|177,635|
|Indiana|449,887|407,229|
|Kansas|1,200,000|740,000|
|Arizona|143,604|70,231|
|Montana|1,200,000|800,000|
|Oklahoma|3,500,000|1,000,000|
|Ohio|3,000,000|1,000,000|
|Federal level|620,942|77,618|
|**Cost Average**|**$1,498,235**|**$683,331**|
Keep in mind that there’s a good amount of variation between state costs, which could come down to different state data collection methods or different processes for other stuff. This does not dispute the higher cost of cases seeking the death penalty, though. This is also just explicit costs, and doesn’t take into account post-execution costs, healthcare matters, etc. which would raise costs further.

So why are death penalty costs so high? [DeathPenaltyInfo](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/policy-issues/costs) provides a basic list of reasons for why the death penalty costs so much, including:

● More stuff happens pre-trial

● Longer trials

● More time spent on jury selection process

# **Policing Efficacy & Corruption**
● [Goldstein et al. 18](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/upload_documents/YOU_policing.pdf)

○ Police departments that collect **more in fees** and fines are **less effective** at solving crimes

○ “Specifically, we find that a **1 percent increase** in the share of own-source revenues from f**ees, fines, and forfeitures** collected by a municipality is associated with a **decrease** in the **violent crime clearance** rate of **3.7 percentage points**”

■ This relationship is proven through a variety of empirical strategies, the details of which are outlined extensively on the methodology

○ Even after adjusting for local crime rates, **militarized police forces are disproportionately dispatched in African-American communities**

○ The common person is less likely to support militarized police forces, so **militarization would worsen the police force’s reputation**

○ **61% of cops "do not always report** even serious criminal violations that **involve the abuse of authority by fellow officers**."

○ **52% of cops** believed that "It is not unusual **for officers to ignore improper conduct** by their fellow officers."

○ A strong majority of cops **allow their fellow officers to get away with misconduct**, and believe that others do it as well. This is indicative of a culture of abuse within police departments

○ The use of force by police is very often improper; according to the DOJ, "**improper force was used in 38 percent of encounters that involved force**." More than one-third of all police uses of force are "improper," and those are just the ones that we know about!

○ The arrest and clearance rates for police are way off. While the number of reported crimes being solved is already absurdly low (**25% on a good year)**, it drops dramatically when we look at all crimes committed.

○ “**The true arrest rates below consider the known crimes compared to the arrest rates for those crimes.193 These numbers will demonstrate that police are solving even less crimes than we may have thought in the last Part. In fact, overall, a 10% arrest rate is typical for the major crimes combined—murder, rape/sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, larceny-theft, burglary, and motor vehicle theft.”** (Overall, the true percent arrested stayed in the 10% range largely between 1990 to 2018. )

○ The overall standard clearance rate, comparing total crimes reported to police with clearance rates in 2018, is **21.64%, meaning 78.36% of crimes are not cleared.**

○  **True clearance rates presumably consider a large swath of crimes that could be reported to police but are not. Starting in 1990, the overall true percent of crimes cleared was 10.03%. In 1998, the true percent cleared was 7.92%.216 For 2004 and 2006, the overall true percent cleared was 9.26% and 9.19%, respectively. For 2009, police improved clearance to 12.10% of overall crimes, and in 2014, it was 11.71%. Finally, in 2018 the overall true percent cleared went back down to 10.61%. Overall, true clearance rates in the last thirty years remained around 10%.**

○ After analyzing the genetic similarity of 1000s of loci, they came to the conclusion that never was the answer (alt-right will spam this answer, but will pay no attention to the following)

○ “On the other hand, if the entire world population were analyzed, the inclusion of many closely related and admixed populations would increase.

○ *“[T]he 85 percent to 90 percent results are based on the accuracy of the method when standards are developed on a subset of a sample and then "tested" on the sample from which the subset was derived. For example, in the 1960s when Eugene Giles and Orville S. Elliot (1962) developed their formula to determine race from the crania, they used a sample that was a sub-set of modern adult Blacks, modern adult Whites and Native American skulls from an archeological site (Goodman 1997b). They applied a statistical procedure—discriminant function that separates crania into “races” using eight measurements. When they applied the formula to the rest of the crania in the same sample, they achieved the much touted 85 percent to 90 percent accuracy. When applied to other samples of Blacks, Whites and Native Americans, they achieved 18.2 percent and 14.3 percent accuracy, figures that hardly instill confidence (Goodman 1997b).”*

Rebuttals:

● It is unclear why studies like Rosenberg et al. 2002, [Tang et al. 2005](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1196372/), and [Guo et al. 2013](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24019100/) are cited as some sort of refutation of social constructivism. Even if the concept of race were not “popped” (note, regardless of which theory of race is preferred, the racialist concept of race should absolutely be “popped”) as described by Hochman, the utility of minimalist races (as described by Hardimon) whereby supporters reject the psychological aspect of race differences in favor of physical differences renders every one of these studies useless for hereditarians seeking to defend the assumed racial categories. Therefore, tying geographic ancestry to ethnic or racial groups does not in any way refute social constructivism.

○ Guo et al. 2013 has its own set of problems. See [here](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://read.dukeupress.edu/demography/article/51/6/2333/169388/The-Molecular-Reinscription-of-Race-A-Comment-on)

○ Rosenberg et al. 2005 is often misinterpreted by hereditarians.

Using STRUCTURE to then say that some genetically distinct population is a race is confusing considering when Rosenberg set K=6, the Kalash people were highlighted. More troubling are the results of Tishkoff in 2009 where they find 3 distinct African groups, Caucasians, and Mongoloids (Oversampling will likely be brought up when mentioning this study but this does not reject the main argument). The question to hereditarians after this argument is as follows: what exactly is the criteria for racehood? Jensen and Rushton simply assumed the existence of race with no definition whatsoever.

● West African Sprinters as evidence of meaningful racial categorization?

○ Often posited is the claim that racial differences are represented in sports such as in the Olympics. For example, most men of the Olympics 100M have been males of West Arica origin. This claim is, however, irrelevant as we would then expect those with the “most West African ancestry” to do best on these events. However, this is not shown from actual data: [see here](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://stillmed.olympic.org/media/Document%20Library/OlympicOrg/IOC/Who-We-Are/Commissions/Medical-and-Scientific-Commission/Encyclopaedia/2011_Bouchard.pdf%23page=137)

○ Respond to two major claims by proponents of the genetic hypothesis:

○ that substantial genetic differences between Black and white populations exist, and which cause the observed gap in cognitive ability and academic achievement

○ that genetic differences associated with cognitive ability are the result of divergent natural selection.

○ *“Results presented here indicate that known biases from population structure, assortative mating, indirect genetic effects, gene-environment interplay, and derived allele frequency differences between African and non-African populations bias polygenic score analysis.”*

○ **Shows**:

○ *“that these biases likely produced false signals of polygenic selection in recent analyses, and that there are no signals of divergent polygenic selection between African and European populations.”*

○ *“I further show the predicted genetic contribution to the Black-white gap in IQ score*

*across a range of heritability estimates was substantially smaller than observed phenotypic gaps, suggesting at least 80% of the IQ variance between Africans and Europeans is environmental in nature under an idealized **“best case scenario” for the hereditarian hypothesis**.”*

● Because of key violations of the model, the estimation for genetic contribution to IQ differences is likely even smaller than the value given. The claims for large, immutable group differences in intelligence and educational attainment are not supported in the least by these analyses.

○ GxE impact on Intelligence

○ This impact leads to complications for the method of correlated vectors

○ Jensen’s effect is, thus, an invalid argument for the g-factor

○  *“Nevertheless, a distinction between g as a statistically entity, and g as interpreted as a realistic,  common cause of individual differences, is not only important theoretically, but also empirically. Consider genetic association and linkage studies of intelligence, for example. So far, the search for genes for general intelligence has met with relatively little success (Deary, Johnson, & Houlihan, 2009; Plomin and Spinath, 2004; Chabris et al., in press). The alternative theories of Dickens and Flynn (2001; Dickens, 2008) and of van der Maas et al. (2006), in which the general factor of intelligence is a statistical entity originating in reciprocal beneficial interactions among cognitive processes or abilities, are able to provide a plausible explanation of this lack of success.”*

○ “Another failure to replicate Lynn's estimate of the average IQ of sub-Saharan Africans” While Lynn finds the average IQ to be at 67 (compared to UK norms after a correlation of the Flynn effect) after their performance in Raven's Progressive Matrices, they criticize his methods for being unsystematic. Once again, they fail to replicate low estimates.

They come to a difference of ten points between his estimate to theirs. The process by which they disproved Lynn’s estimate is shown: “(1) our use of systematic methods and a lack thereof in Lynn's work; (2) our use of weighting by sample size to estimate the mean IQ across samples and Lynn's indifference to sample sizes; (3) our decision not to include unhealthy samples, which Lynn admitted; (4) our exclusion of samples in which test administration had met with problems, which Lynn attributes to low cognitive ability of test-takers; (5) our exclusion of data from the Coloured Progressive Matrices (CPM) for ages above 11 because the conversion from CPM scores to adult and adolescent norms for the Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM) artificially lowers the IQ; (6) Lynn's exclusion of a number of high-IQ samples that he deemed unrepresentative; and (7) Lynn's ad hoc downward correction of mean IQs from primary and secondary school students by two and six IQ points, respectively”* (Wicherts et al… 10 [pg. 1]).

○ **TWIN STUDIES**: *“The math of twin studies is based on the assumption that environments encountered by identical twins are no more similar than environments encountered by fraternal twins. However, the formulas are not sound if identical twins, in addition to having more genetic similarity, are also exposed to more environmental similarity; in that case, increased similarities in identical twins’ traits can just as easily be accounted for by environmental similarities as by genetic similarities.”*  (NOTE: corrections for EEA by determinists are useless as *“Studies have, however, found demonstrable EEA effects**13–16** that effectively invalidate the assumptions upon which heritability claims rely.”*)

○ (regarding twin studies): *“while fraternal twin embryos are always connected to their mother via two **unique** placentas, identical twins most often (but not always) share a **single** placenta. This means that, beginning soon after conception, identical twins typically have more similar access to nutrients, oxygen, and other factors than do fraternal twins (Figure 3). But does this increased similarity matter? Yes. In fact, identical twins who share a placenta as fetuses have more similar IQs* [[here](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/568880)] *and personalities* [[here](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7487842/)] *than do identical twins who did not share a placenta.”*

○ __IMPORTANCE: *“*__*Because genetic and nongenetic factors interact with one another to produce phenotypes, it is not possible to accurately assess the relative importance of their contributions to the phenotypes they produce.”*

○ **VARIATION VS CAUSATION: “***Thus, focusing on variation rather than causation can contribute to a misleading sense of how important a particular factor might be in contributing to a particular outcome.”* (Conclusion of the house fires example given in that section)

● Epigenetic similarity:

○ The finding that monozygotic twins have higher concordances for methylation, but that the frequency of contact among twins was correlated with concordance from Fraga 05 is in conjunction with other evidence. Also been found in varying types of cells, and most studies support epigenomic, environmental or developmental causes ([Kaminsky et. al 2009](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19151718), [Poulsen et. al 2007](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17413848), [Wong et. al 2010](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.4161/epi.5.6.12226), [Ollikainen et. al 2010](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article/19/21/4176/665273/), [Martino et. al 2013](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2013-14-5-r42)).

○ Response to BARNES and WRIGHT

○ "We argued that heritability studies are futile for two reasons: 1) Heritability studies suffer from serious methodological flaws with the overall effect of making estimates inaccurate and biased toward inflated heritability and deflated shared environmental influences, and more importantly, 2) the conceptual biological model on which heritability studies depend—that of identifiably separate effects of genes versus the environment on phenotype variance—is unsound."

○ found that MZ twin concordance on methylation was 2-16 times greater than DZ twin concordance, and found that this is very likely to be the result of a developmental process. They concluded that their findings could explain some of the missing heritability, as heritability of traits could be overestimated due to the violation of the equal environment assumption.

## ADOPTION STUDIES
While adoption studies suffer fewer flaws than do Twin studies ([Joseph 2013](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123979469000051)), there are still flaws to note.

● [Richardson & Norgate (2006)](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://rpadgett.butler.edu/ps320/coursedocs/Richardson-Norgate.pdf)

○ Adoption studies (specifically dealing with comparing the correlation of the adopted children to their biological parents and their adoptive parents) suffer from range restriction, selective placement, and family unit effects

○ Moreover, both forms of adoptee studies suffer from the issue of confounds from epigenetic inheritance, effects from the prenatal and pre-adoptive environment.

● [van Ijzendoorn et al. 2005](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15740423/)

○ International adoption studies provide another piece of converging evidence that rearing environment does have long-lasting impacts on cognitive function

○ Meta analysis that found average effect of adoption of 18 points when extremely deprived institutional settings were included in the comparison

● [Leve et. al (2014)](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10519-014-9678-2)

○ report significant mean increases in achievement and IQ despite near-null correlations of adoptive parent and adoptees

● REBUTTAL TO: [McGue et. al (2007)](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17279339)

○ Argument: Source purportedly demonstrates that not only does restriction of range not have a significant impact on the shared environmentality components estimated [1], but that socioeconomic status itself does not impact IQ.

○ The source’s estimates of SES are not good enough. the measures were only parental education and occupational status, both of which are known to be imperfect representations of socioeconomic status ([American Psychological Association 2006](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.apa.org/pi/ses/resources/publications/task-force-2006.pdf); [Lott 2012](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23163450); [Kraus & Tan 2015](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103115000062))

○ The second issue here is that their method of testing for variance reduction was to compare to the group of adoptive families in their sample to the group of ‘biological families’ in their sample..The sample of ‘biological families’ has a much smaller range of environments than that of the general population ([Nisbett et. al 2012](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c03f/f20904c35a370534a9d3710453dd6dc7a2d2.pdf))

○ Also the regression coefficient of socioeconomic status on IQ in adoptive families is positive (page 458, Table 4), but the 95% confidence interval includes zero (likely due to the low power in the study & issues with indices).

○ Even then, extended familial studies have greater power to distinguish between confounded variance components ([Rao et. al 1976](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/944529)), which universally show smaller estimates ([Marcus & Feldman 2018](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rstb.2017.0064)).

○ McGue provides an explanation for reduction in variance, but see [here](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://developmentalsystem.wordpress.com/2019/10/09/an-updated-review-of-iq-adoption-studies/)

■ "Here we show how, in the context of CA and EA as approximation measures, spurious correlations in GWAS/PGS can arise in a number of ways, particularly from genetic population structure. We review recent studies suggesting that attempts to control for such confounds have been quite inadequate, and also criticize the underlying statistical assumptions and genetic model."

■ [unrelated to section; more to do with performance] *Finally, different social conditions also lead to different affective orientations, such as self-confidence and achievement expectancies, that impact on school learning and test performances (Frankenhuis & de Weerth, 2013; Odgers, 2015; Schmader, Johns, & Forbes, 2008). The effects of test anxiety on cognitive performance are well known, and have been estimated to affect up to 15%–20% of school children (Chin, Williams, Taylor, & Harvey, 2017). In addition, feelings of social rejection effect test performances and self-regulation (Stillman & Baumeister, 2013).*

■ *In sum, whatever else CA and EA scores measure, they at least partly reflect a socio-psychological population structure in ways probably unrelated to any general cognitive or learning ability.*

■ Eurocentric biases in GWAS (further see [Coop 19](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.00892.pdf) for gene-gene & gene-environment interactions as a cause for the misinterpretations stated above)

■ Claim from above: “*GPS are unique predictors in the behavioural sciences. They are an exception to the rule that correlations do not imply causation in the sense that there can be no backward causation when GPS are correlated with traits. That is, nothing in our brains, behaviour or environment changes inherited differences in DNA sequence. A related advantage of GPS as predictors is that they are exceptionally stable throughout the life span because they index inherited differences in DNA sequence. Although mutations can accrue in the cells used to obtain DNA, like any cells in the body these mutations would not be expected to change systematically the thousands of inherited SNPs that contribute to a GPS.”*

■ Firstly view above sources on how the studies are skewed towards european populations and also that “scores derived from GWA studies which are associational and therefore cannot show causes” (see Martin et al. 17 above, [Curtis 18](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30160659/), and [Haworth et al. 18](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://europepmc.org/article/ppr/ppr14690))

■ “PGSs are also carried out based on the assumption that the heritability estimates derived from twin/family/adoption studies tell us anything about how “genetic” a trait is. But, since the EEA is false ([Joseph, 2014](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.amazon.com/Trouble-Twin-Studies-Jay-Joseph/dp/113869892X); [Joseph et al, 2015](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/logosjournal.com/2015/joseph-twin-research/)) then we should outright reject any and all genetic interpretations of these kinds of studies.”

■ Further see how in the above citations of richardson that demonstrates how these studies show:  the population structure of the population sampled in question as well as ([Zaidi and Mathieson, 2020](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://elifesciences.org/articles/61548)) finding that the demographic history of the sample in question can also mediate the stratification of the population

■ Firstly, there is an issue of interpretation. Lee et al. was [portrayed](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.colorado.edu/today/2018/07/23/scientists-id-more-1200-genes-linked-educational-attainment) as a study finding "genes linked to educational attainment" when this was not the intent

● A corresponding author Daniel Benjamin stated, “It would be completely misleading to characterize our results as identifying genes for education” ([here](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/07/180723142848.htm))

● the Social Science Genetic Association Consortium (sponsors of Lee et al.) specify in responses to [FAQs](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.thessgac.org/faqs) that they did not find the gene/s for educational attainment (FAQ 3.1, 3.2)(Regardless of which study they refer to on educational attainment, this remains true)

● The study ITSELF also cautions “Our results also highlight two caveats to the use of the polygenic scores in research. First, our within-family analyses suggest that GWAS estimates may overstate the causal effect sizes [...] Without controls for this bias, it is therefore inappropriate to interpret the polygenic score for educational attainment as a measure of genetic endowment”

● Finally, the study confirms a slew of other studies that there is “lower predictive power in a sample of African-American individuals than in a sample of individuals with an European ancestry” (remember the study only reported an incremental R2 of 1.6% for African-Americans)

■ Addressing PS?

● However, the study itself (Lee et al. specifies nurturing as a potential area of future research because GWAS results could be overstating causal effects), as well as studies like Kong et al. 2018, specify that “While the correlation between the polygenic score and educational attainment suggests that it can predict around 11–13% of the variation in educational attainment, within-family analyses suggest that at least half of this predictive ability comes from indirect genetic effects from relatives, population stratification, and assortative mating”(quote itself from [Young et al. 2019](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008222))

● [Richardson & Jones 2019](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0732118X1830196X) specify in response to “controls for...population structure” that “the assumption that siblings share the same environment is a misunderstanding of the conditions of human development and social-cognition.” He then cites factors like different treatment that can lead to reactive “within family effects not usually considered in simple additive variance-partitioning models. Any SNPs unrelated to cognitive ability, but adventitiously correlating with those physical attributes, will spuriously correlate with CA/EA.”

● Even more damning, a 2021 [paper](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://academic.oup.com/ije/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ije/dyaa288/6133127) by Richardson and others utilizes the method of "negative control" to provide further evidence of the widespread and persistent influence of PS DESPITE attempts at correction. Importantly, this influence seems especially strong for complex traits such as "years of schooling" widely utilized in Lee et al.

● While the impacts of SES differ based on the study ([Mostafavi et al. 2020](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.proquest.com/openview/e16c5203a584fa976312b20318d8b3ea/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=2045579)), in samples that are unrepresentative, problems occur. Lee et al. includes many medical data sets and the 23andMe data set, which are not representative of the national population. Furthermore, individuals in the UK Biobank have a higher SES than the rest of the population ([Fry et al. 2017](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/186/9/1026/3883629)). Also plausible is that people who participate in GWAS differ, for different reasons, from those who do not ([Taylor et al. 2018](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/47/4/1207/5001767)). Thus, these results make it more difficult to generalize the results of GWAS-based estimates

● Mostafavi et al. also compared the “ prediction accuracy when the PGS is trained on ‘unrelated’ individuals such as those used in a standard GWAS to one obtained from a sibling-based (or ‘sib-based’) GWAS (Materials and methods)”

● They found that there are “lower prediction accuracies for PGS based on sib-based GWAS” which “indicate that complications such as assortative mating or indirect effects contribute to the standard GWAS estimates”

● The application of Mostafavi’s results to Lee et al. is that they find prediction accuracy can differ even across groups with similar ancestry. They also imply that controlling for environmental variance will not be enough as factors like “differences in the magnitude of genetic effects among groups, indirect effects and assortative mating, also lead to differences in the prediction accuracy of PGS, in ways that may make applications of phenotypic prediction less reliable, even within a single ancestry group”

○ *“For example, tests like the Raven nearly all require the reading of elements in a matrix from top-left to bottom-right, just as in (Western) text. But they also embed further rules than that, far from. Being experience free, mimic those in record sheets, timetables, or other tables of rows and columns, with totals and subtotals. The rules involve additions, subtractions, and substitutions of symbols across columns and down rows, and the deduction of new information from them.”*

John Raven constructed problems that focused on each of six different problem characteristics, which approximately correspond to the different types of rules that we describe later. He used his intuition and clinical experience to rank order the difficulty of the six problem types.”*

○ *“In the Raven test, more difficult problems tended to involve more abstract rules than the less difficult problems. (Interestingly, the level of abstraction of even the most difficult rule, distribution of two values, does not seem particularly great compared with the abstractions that are taught and acquired in various academic domains, such as physics or political science.)”*

○ *A consistent 15-20 point IQ differential existed between the more economically privileged, better educated, urban-based, English-speaking whites and the lower-scoring, rural-based, poor, white Afrikaners. To avoid comparisons that would have led to political tensions between the two white groups, South African IQ testers squelched discussion about genetic differences between the two European ethnicities. They solved the problem by composing a modified version of the IQ test in Afrikaans. In this way, they were able to normalize scores between the two white cultural groups.*

○  *“Results indicate that use of the Ravens may substantially underestimate the intelligence of children in Mali”*

○ *European and North American children may spend more time with play tasks such as jigsaw puzzles or connect the dots that have similarities with the Ravens and, thus, train on similar tasks more than do African children. If African children spend less time on similar tasks, they would have fewer opportunities to train for the Ravens (however unintentionally) reflecting in poorer scores. In this sense, verbal ability need not be the only pitfall in selecting culturally sensitive IQ testing approaches. Thus, differences in Ravens scores may be a cultural artifact rather than an indication of true intelligence differences.*

○ IQ TESTS CANNOT BE FRAMED AS AN EGALITARIAN DEVICE

■ *“Like IQ tests, the hereditarian-environmentalist debate is immersed in mythology. In fact, this debate has revolved around IQ testing for so long that the myths surrounding each are not only intertwined but interdependent.*

■ *According to its image, the nature-nurture debate pits conservatives against liberals. One part of this image reflects reality; part is mythical; environmentalistsm has not only liberal and radical supporters, but many conservative ones as well.*

■ *One factor that sustains the deabte’s liberal-versus-conservative image is that many environmentalists have condemned the hereditarians’ claims of genetic intelligence differentials between races and classes as a justification for class and racial inequality. At the same time, however, environmetalists present their own thesis — which accepts the claim of class and racial intelligence differentials but attributes the alleged differentials to environment rather than heredity — as an alternative to hereditarianism. But is their thesis in fact an alternative to hereditarianism? Or does it instead — irrespective of the mentions of many environmentalists — result in an alternative justification for class and racial inequality?: (pg. 10-11)*

○ Example of test construction in action

○ In South Africa in the 1950s there was a 15-point difference in IQ between two white cultural groups. Rather than fan flames of political tension between the groups, the test was changed in order to eliminate the difference between the two groups. The same, she notes, was the case regarding IQ differences between men and women—Terman eliminated such differences by picking and choosing certain items that favored one group and balanced them out so that they scored near-equally. These are two great examples from the 20th century that demonstrate the reflexivity in psychology—how one’s a priori biases influence what they study and the types of conclusions they draw from data.

● *“Poor people are poor because they have lower IQs”*

○ Very simple response (see Richardson 17). Societies are socially stratified. Because of this stratification, a genetic stratification is maintained. Thus, social class stratification creates cognitive differences. IQ tests show these differences (which are as a result of this social class stratification). Also genetic differences between classes are irrelevant to educational attainment (further, see: [here](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://genome.cshlp.org/content/12/6/844.full.pdf), [here](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.bmj.com/content/352/bmj.i582), [here](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797617707270), [here](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.nature.com/articles/mp2016107?report=reader), and [here](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/294876v1))

○ Regarding IQ testing

○ *“I shall argue that the basic source of variation in IQ test scores is not entire (or even mainly) cognitive, and what is cognitive is not general or unitary. It arises from a nexus or sociocognitive-affective factors determining individuals: relative preparedness for the demands of the IQ test.”*

○ GWAS IQ gene associations are correlations which are inevitable and meaningless and due to social class. It’s due to class stratification which cause genetic differences not related to ‘cognitive ability’ or ‘educational attainment’.

○ *“In summary, either directly or indirectly, IQ and related tests are calibrated against social class background, and score differences are inevitably consequences of that social stratification to some extent. Through that calibration, they will also correlate with any genetic cline within the social strata. Whether or not, and to what degree, the tests also measure “intelligence” remains debatable because test validity has always been indirect and circular.”*

The alt-right, like other political lobbyists, think tanks, and pressure groups, do not exist for their own sake—they pursue a long-term goal of changing the nature of political and popular discourse (Stefancic & Delgado, 1996). The superficial absence of race from the language of popular IQ-ism does not denote any lessening in the racist quality of such assertions. Hereditarians frequently set out their plans for highly selective IQbased education, such as Plomin’s “genetically-sensitive school” (Asbury & Plomin, 2013) and Martin’s “smart fraction schools” (2016). Their prescriptions do not mention race, but the racist impact against black students would inevitably follow based on everything we know about the racialized consequences of such profiling, whether by IQ test, teacher assessment, or some combination of the two."* (Gillborn 18 [pg. 74])

○ In medical school entrants, IQ has no predictive power.

○ *“However, individuals within the pool of applicants who fail to get in to medical school because of poor A-level grades never take medical school examinations, so we can never find out whether, had they been allowed in, they would have done as badly as they did in their A-levels, or whether they would have confounded expectations and done well. This restriction of range means that in the selected group (those who enter medical school) the correlation of the selection measure (for example, A-levels) with the outcome measure (for example, first year medical school examinations) will necessarily be weaker than would be the case if performance were to have been assessed across the whole range of medical school applicants. That situation could only be assessed empirically if entrants were to be a random, representative sample from the pool of all applicants, with A-level grades at all levels of achievement. Statistical solutions to the problem of range restriction have been explored for many decades [5] and the problem is now statistically tractable [6, 7], so that validity coefficients for selection as a whole (so-called ‘construct validity’) can therefore be calculated.”*

○ *“This article adds a further empirical dimension to the debate over policy alternatives. Specifically, to the extent that the link between IQ and ultimate job-performance is mediated by developmental resources allocated on the basis of IQ-reflective scores, the case for allocating developmental resources based on IQ is weakened. Said another way, if a society could allocate resources on a given criterion (say, eye-color) and produce a strong correlation with job performance, then differentiated resource allocations become less justifiable. Conversely, the IQ-based allocation of developmental resources becomes more justifiable to the extent that: (1) variance in ultimate job performance is explained by immutable differences in mental processing and (2) these differences are captured by IQ tests. In short, there are a number of empirical questions that need to be answered before it is possible to make moral or policy judgments. Foremost: to what extent is the connection between IQ and job performance a function of institutionalized, IQ-based allocations of developmental resources?”*

○ *"Absent the opportunity to assimilate into an environment that is matched to their new cognitive capacity (a forced loss in gene-environment correlation), it would be difficult to maintain or amplify the initial benefits afforded by the early intervention. Thus, much like the inter-generational Flynn effect, increases in IQ might be amplified, or at least sustained, by greater access to opportunities that often are inequitably distributed. In simpler terms, the analysis of Protzko should not lead us to conclude that early intervention programs such as Head Start can have no long-term benefits. Rather, these results highlight the need to provide participants with continuing opportunities that would allow them to capitalize on what might otherwise be transient gains in cognitive abilities."* (Sauce & Matzel 18)

○ Howe examines Zigler & Seitz's study. They measured the effects of a four year intervention program which emphasized math skills. They were inner-city children who were enrolled in the program at kindergarten. The program was successful, in that those who participated in the program were two years ahead of a control group, but a few heads after in a follow-up, they were only a year ahead.

○ **Howe explains why:** "For instance, to score well at the achievement tests used with older children it is essential to have some knowledge of algebra and geometry, but Seitz found that while the majority of middle-class children were being taught these subjects, the disadvantaged pupils were not getting the necessary teaching. For that reason they could hardly be expected to do well. As Seitz perceived, the true picture was not one of fading ability but of diminishing use of it."

○ Mutualism is very different from g (one early criticism of mutualism was of the difference). The authors stress how the validity of the mutualism model, if true, would render the search for a gene or brain area "for g" useless (also see [Van der Maas et al. 2014](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.mdpi.com/2079-3200/2/1/12/htm)).

○ 1. The Mutualism model doesn't specify the age at which statistical g factor should become stable ([McFarland 20](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=yLXkDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA436&dq=mutualism+theory+of+intelligence+vs+g&ots=yCdCLqi7m7&sig=CnBUSmFFlsmLiH78GpOjs8J798U%23v=onepage&q=mutualism%20theory%20of%20intelligence%20vs%20g&f=false) pg. 117)

○ 2. it is unclear what g predicts but see Gignac’s argument:

■ “According to Gignac, g factor theory may be suggested to predict the strength of the g factor to be largely constant across all ages, because this theory postulates biological and genetic substrates for g” (pg. 117) (claim originally from pg. 90 of Gignac 14)

○ 3. Data on age differentiation and (de)differentiation is rather inconclusive (ex. Hofman and Gignac papers clash)

○ Regarding Gignac's argument, “But the biological substrate is all but constant in childhood, and g-theory unspecific with regards to such developmental issues.”

● Appeals to parsimony (Gignac 2016b already addressed above)

○ The g model is more expensive despite the amount of parameters in the mutualism model

○ Authors do not assume some mysterious latent variable that itself comes with assumptions ([Conway et al. 2021](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1047840X.2020.1853468), [Goring et al. 2019](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://psyarxiv.com/hvzyx/))

○ Finally, Gignac’s paper is dated. We already know Mutualism is better, in theory and fit, than g

● Far transfer

○ *"Moreover, M can be sparse and still give rise to a positive manifold. Many kinds of restrictions may be placed on the elements in the matrix M, which can be based on theoretical considerations, or the results of experimental studies. To explain the positive manifold, it suffices to assume Mij = c for all subjects."*  ([Van der Maas et al. 2019](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://psyarxiv.com/e96m8/download?format=pdf))

● Finally, the recent successes in finding genome sequence differences accounting for significant contributions to the heritability of intelligence isn't an argument against mutualism. They don't prove g is a biological causal entity. Studies cited to this effect like [Plomin & Stumm 2018](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29335645/) are actually inconsistent with the biological unitary g factor as they find genetic effects on intelligence pleiotropic and 100,000s of SNP associations are needed to account for the 50% heritability estimate estimated by twin studies.

# **Race and Craniology**
There is a huge section about this in [this document debunking scientific racist myths](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-ZJhkME8qqfm7GVLLk8tGwWNriWCl8UTRMlcCuNW-_Q/edit%23heading=h.xcbe3fwsse0q), which debunks both the premises behind studies of craniology in race, and debunks many specific studies used by racists
# **Public Perception (Regarding genetics)**
` `“… people seem to deploy elements of fatalism or determinism into their worldviews or life goals when they suit particular ends, either in ways that are thought to ‘explain’ why other groups are the way they are or in ways that lessen their own sense of personal responsibility (Condit, 2011)” ([Alexander, 2017: 17-18](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/genes-determinism-and-god/FBC3ADE65CD0C8F211D2AED04A0D7D92)).

the public understands genes as playing more of a role when it comes to bodily traits and environment plays more of a role when it comes to things that humans have agency over—for things relating to the mind ([Condit & Shen 11](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.karger.com/Article/PDF/314915))

# **Testosterone Differences?**
Often cited by hereditarians are inaccurate claims on the differences of Testosterone (T) between races and its implications.

Here are some sources often cited by hereditarians to support their hierarchical view on testosterone differences and counterarguments:

● [**Lynn 2013**](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://7est.ro/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/https:__lesacreduprintemps19.files.wordpress.com_2012_03_an-examination-of-rushton_s-theory-of-differences-in-penis-length-and-circumference-and-r-k-life-history-theory-in-113-populations.pdf)

○ Claims “Testosterone is a determinant of aggression” from the sources (Book, Starzyk, & Quinsey, 2001; Brooks & Reddon, 1996; Dabbs, 2000) (pg. 2)

■ **This is inaccurate as there is only a correlation between aggression and testosterone ([Book, Starzyk and Quinsey, 2001](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/www.academia.edu/22213818/The_relationship_between_testosterone_and_aggression_a_meta-analysis) shows a .14 correlation,  [Archer, Graham-Kevan, and Davies 2005**](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257525063_Testosterone_and_aggression_A_reanalysis_of_Book_Starzyk_and_Quinsey)** show a lesser .08 correlation).

■ **Problems arise as, from [Sapolsky 1997**](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.amazon.com/dp/0684838915/ref=redir_mobile_desktop?_encoding=UTF8&dpID=61jqPbMogeL&dpPl=1&psc=1&refRID=39CCXDZZZEVGFXS8BW6V&ref_=pd_aw_sim_14_1)** see:

● ***Okay, suppose you note a correlation between levels of aggression and levels of testosterone among these normal males. This could be because (a)  testosterone elevates aggression; (b) aggression elevates testosterone secretion; (c) neither causes the other. There’s a huge bias to assume option a while b is the answer. Study after study has shown that when you examine testosterone when males are first placed together in the social group, testosterone levels predict nothing about who is going to be aggressive. The subsequent behavioral differences drive the hormonal changes, not the other way around. (***pg. 113)

■ Further, Brooks & Reddon also show a relationship and nothing more. Dabbs 2000 relates to prisoners and found that violent prisoners had higher testosterone. However, they ignore that being aggressive stimulates testosterone,not that testosterone causes aggression

● [**Edward Dutton's 2015 Presentation**](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3c4TxciNeJZdmJ1MkwyNW1KNFk/view)

○ Edward Dutton claims: blacks are expected to be the highest on testosterone, East Asians are the lowest, and Europeans are intermediate.

■ **This is directly refuted by [McGreal**](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/unique-everybody-else/201601/race-differences-in-androgens-do-they-mean-anything)** 

● [Ross et al. 1986](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article-abstract/76/1/45/1006122)

○ One of the most cited pieces of literature to make the claim that black people have higher levels of testosterone than whites

○ The study tests the hypothesis that black males were exposed to more testosterone in the womb and this then drove their higher rates of prostate cancer later in life. They come to the conclusion that the mean total testosterone level for black people was 19 percent higher than white people whereas free testosterone was 21 percent higher. The adjusted level ended up being 15% however, something Rushton 1997 ignores.

■ Testosterone does not cause prostate cancer, for one (see [Stattin et al. 2003](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14648709/),  [Michaud, Billups, and Partin, 2015](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4647137/), [Boyle et al. 16](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26779889/) )

■ Further, their assay times between 10 AM and 2 PM present an issue of differences in testosterone as the times change. This is still a major confound. Even taking into account their claims of adjusting for this variable (pg. 47). So is waist circumference which wasn’t controlled for

■ Their sample size is also small (50 blacks and 50 whites) and done on college students meaning it isn’t representative on a larger scale

■  Finally, more recent analyses like that of [Richard et al. 14](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4327897/) find a smaller 2.5 to 4.9 percent difference

■ What can explain higher levels of prostate cancer then? One answer often posited by people like RR could be that of nutrition (see: [here](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2241107/), [here](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1472821/), and [here](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1470481/))

○ Found that black people had 3 percent higher levels of testosterone than white people.

● Furthermore, claims on the supposed higher level of testosterone of Black women compared to White women are inaccurate: see [here](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://notpoliticallycorrect.me/2017/10/06/no-black-women-do-not-have-higher-testosterone-than-white-women-and-more-on-hereditarian-claims-on-racial-testosterone-differences/)

● What about Asians? See [here](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://ethnicmuse.wordpress.com/2013/04/19/east-asian-testosterone-i/)

● Now, because the racial differences in testosterone have shown to be vastly lower than hereditarians claim, connections to crime are also inaccurate. no matter if it’s prenatal androgen exposure or not, the evidence is clear that testosterone is not the cause of things like prostate cancer, aggression, and crime (for crime see [here](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/racehist.blogspot.com/2009/10/can-racial-differences-in-circulating.html?m=1) and [here](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://notpoliticallycorrect.me/2017/06/18/why-testosterone-does-not-cause-crime/))

● **CLAIM: Middle class black people commit more crime than poor white people.**

○ Actually, no, that's not at all true. In fact, while there is a correlation between black people and Hispanics and crime, the data imply a much stronger tie between poverty and crime than crime and any racial group, when gender is taken into consideration. The direct correlation between crime and class, when factoring for race alone, is relatively weak. When gender, and familial history are factored, class correlates more strongly with crime than race or ethnicity. Studies indicate that areas with low socioeconomic status may have the greatest correlation of crime with young and adult males, regardless of racial composition, though its effect on females is negligible. A 1996 study looking at data from Columbus, Ohio found that differences in disadvantage in city neighborhoods explained the vast majority of the difference in crime rates between blacks and whites, and a 2003 study looking at violent offending among juveniles reached similar conclusions. [http://critcrim.org/barak.htm](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/critcrim.org/barak.htm) [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-9125.2000.tb00900.x](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-9125.2000.tb00900.x) [https://doi.org/10.1093%2Fsf%2F75.2.619](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/75.2.619) [https://doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1745-9125.2003.tb01002.x](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-9125.2003.tb01002.x) [https://doi.org/10.1080%2F07418820300095441](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://doi.org/10.1080/07418820300095441)

● **CLAIM: If poverty causes crime, why aren't the black and hispanic crime rates the same, since they have similar poverty rates?**

○ Because that's not how "causation" works. There's no one factor that just directly drives something like "homicide rates". Community violence is a confluence of multiple factors: [“Neighborhoods’ incidence of violent crime is related to an array of  intertwined characteristics, including poverty, segregation, and  inequality; collective efficacy, disorder, trust, and institutions; job  access; immigration; residential instability, foreclosures, vacancy  rates, and evictions; land use and the built environment; neighborhood  change; and location of housing assistance. These characteristics can be  both the cause and result of violent crime.”](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.huduser.gov/portal/periodicals/em/summer16/highlight2.html) Every case of violence is going to have a literal universe of causative factors behind it unique to each person, place, and thing involved. To follow up, while poverty is generally accepted as having a positive correlation with homicide and likely playing a causative role it may not affect each population at the same rate and other factors are also driving that rate up or down. Additionally rather than looking at poverty alone [it's more common to look at broader structural differences](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://academic.oup.com/socpro/article-abstract/49/3/349/1643012). These can include poverty, unemployment, education levels, unemployment, racial segregation, and urban environments, among other factors.  Again these factors may not have the same impact in each population. For example the above study found levels of college education in black populations had negative effects on homicide rates approximately two or three times larger than those found in white or latino populations. Larger percentages of people born outside of the United States had a positive impact on homicide in white populations but a negative impact on latino populations. Another idea that may help explain the higher homicide rates in black populations are the southern culture of violence. The idea is that higher rates if violence in the south east can be partially explained by cultural ideals emphasizing personal honor and condoning lethal violence.  [One study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1533-8525.2007.00078.x) found that higher homicide rates were correlated with higher percentages of southern born whites in the area both in and outside of the south. Since the south has much higher black populations this could disproportionately impact overall black homicide rates. Similarly there's been an [increasing importance placed in transgenerational trauma](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.apa.org/monitor/2019/02/legacy-trauma). While there haven't been as many studies on African American populations those performed on families of holocaust survivors suggests that the impacts of trauma on previous generations can directly impact the chances of psychological disorders in their descendants.  This is likely due to changes in parenting styles and worldviews.  I know there is some ongoing research into epigenetics and generational trauma but I don't feel comfortable extrapolating conclusions from it. So the basic idea is that the lasting psychological impacts of slavery and violent racism continue in to the present generation. To expand, poverty itself does not "cause" homicide as some malevolent force. It is best to understand poverty in terms of protective and risk factors. For example, if you are poor, you may lack education, which may also mean you lack employment, which means you may be on the streets more often, have [more opportunities](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://crimesciencejournal.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/2193-7680-1-3.pdf) to enter a fight or assault someone, and perhaps also more reasons to do so (less to lose, more needs, ...). It also means you live in worse neighborhoods, in worse material and social conditions. However, there is more than just “poverty” to what characterizes a neighborhood! In terms of protective factors, see for example [De Fronzo's 1997 study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022427897034003005) about welfare and its impact on homicide rates (which concludes that reducing welfare may increase homicide rates). Thus, [Tittle and Meier wrote in 1990](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-9125.1990.tb01326.x): “Where does this leave us, then, in trying to account for delinquency with the help of SES? It appears, on the basis of the recent evidence, that SES may not be nearly so important as many seem to think (Braithwaite, 1981; Kleck, 1982; Nettler, 1978, 1985), but it may well be more important than others have concluded (Tittle et al., 1978). But the circumstances under which individual SES plays a role in delinquency production remains elusive. Sometimes SES does appear to predict delinquency; most of the time it does not [...] SES may be a poor proxy for the numerous causal variables that are supposedly embodied within it.” [Wright et al.](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-9125.1999.tb00483.x) wrote in 2006: “SES has a negative effect upon delinquency through some mediators, that SES has a positive effect upon delinquency through other mediators, and that these negative and positive effects coexist and can cancel each other out. As a result, there can be many causal links between SES and delinquency but little overall correlation.” And according to [Brookman and Robinson](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://global.oup.com/ukhe/product/the-oxford-handbook-of-criminology-9780198719441) in 2012: “As Levi (1997: 860) noted, macrolevel accounts ‘seldom generate anything close to a causal account which makes sense of nonviolence as well as of violence’. Put another way, the vast majority of individuals who live in conditions of poverty or disadvantage do not resort to violence at any time. Hence, in order to understand the patterns of violence that actually occur, it is imperative to study the social experiences of those who engage in it (Athens 1992).” Putting aside poverty, there are several other concepts to keep into account, such as [inequality](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/does-lower-inequality-lead-less-crime) and [relative deprivation](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224545.2018.1549013), which are not synonyms of poverty or absolute deprivation. Note that not all of these disadvantages are equally distributed among minority groups, such that specific disadvantages can afflict African Americans to a greater extent than Hispanic Americans.

● **CLAIM: Being poor doesn't excuse crime.**

○ No one is claiming that it does, but if you are poor, you are statistically more likely to commit a crime. It isn’t a determinant of whether or not you will, and statistics only describe qualities of a sample or population, not individuals.

● **CLAIM: [black-on-white rape is far more prevalent than white-on-black rape](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/605772991397363712/721452236219088948/580643d3c5240220008b5165.png), according to 2008 BJS numbers.**

○ [Those numbers use absurdly small sample sizes, something which the BJS doesn’t do anymore](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.businessinsider.com/stupid-racist-meme-rape-black-men-2016-10) 

■ “*In other words, a sample size this tiny simply cannot be understood to tell us anything about what's going on at the population level. The odds of picking any 10 or fewer women out of a crowd whose experiences have nothing to do with what's typical are far, far too high.*”

■ Lynn Langton, the person who looked over those sorts of stats at BJS, said herself that they don’t stand by that data anymore due to its lack of reliability

○ [A 2017 report from the BJS](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/rhovo1215.pdf), using more reliable data, actually disproves the claim and instead suggests that even when you take rape and group it up with other similar crimes, you see that black-on-white crime (14.7% of crime on whites) is roughly the same as white-on-black crime (10.9% of crime on blacks). Keep in mind that this is before controlling for factors like socioeconomic status, family relations ([the vast majority of rape victims know their perpetrator personally](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/most-victims-know-their-attacker)), etc.

■ The obvious conclusion of the numbers in the report is that intra-racial rape and related crimes are much more common than inter-racial crime, not that black-on-white crime is much worse than white-on-black crime. This makes sense too once you consider that most criminals don’t care what your skin color is and most rob in their own neighborhood or close by, and what kind of people are you going to find in predominantly black neighborhoods? Black people.

○ Black isolation emerges as a strong predictor of the rates of black violence in major U.S. cities, a finding that may account for prior evidence of a link between segregation and violence at the macro level

● **CLAIM: Asian people were oppressed and interned during ww2 and discriminated against afterwards, so why aren't they as bad off as blacks are?**

○ These days, the majority of America's Asian population is only one or two generations removed from legal immigrants who came to America for merit-based citizenship. That automatically put them, on average, at an advantage -- even over poor white Americans.

○ Immigration from Asia was historically suppressed by legislation like the Chinese Exclusion Act (1882) and the Immigration Act of 1924. It wasn’t until the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1965 that immigration from Asia boomed. [In just over 50 years, the population of Asian Americans went from 980,000 in 1960 to 20.4 million in 2015](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/09/08/key-facts-about-asian-americans/) -- 1960 was *after* the WWII concentration camps. Today 72% of the adult US Asian population was born outside of the US.

○ Being a heavily-immigrant population, Asian Americans on average have a better education and background compared both to the average white or native-born American and compared to the general populations in their country of origin, due to selection processes by America’s immigration system.

■ **Poor Asian and Indian communities have much lower crime rates.**

○ This is often because they have vastly lower population densities. But Vietnam and Cambodia have much higher crime indices than the United States and multiple African countries, and Bangladesh has a higher crime index than most African countries.

● **CLAIM: But look at Chicago!**

○ ⁠We know Chicago has "more crime", there are more people there. But when you actually compare the amount of crime to the population, Chicago doesn't even break the top 25 worst cities ([18.26 murders per 100,000](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/murder-map-deadliest-u-s-cities/)).

○ Analysis of 4 core arguments hereditarians make in their claims about being silenced

■ 1. **Experts in the topic broadly agree** that there is good scientific support for the idea that there is an important genetic contribution to enduring differences in intelligence and other socially important traits between the biologically real White and Black races.

■ 2. The ideas expressed in #1 are **strictly scientific** and must be evaluated as nonpolitical ideas. (Note: race, and IQ research is inseparable from social policy.)

■ 3. **This scientific fact is opposed for political, not scientific reasons**. Those reasons include a blind adherence to unscientific doctrines of human equality and liberal bias

■ 4. The opposition to hereditarian scientists takes the form of **character assassination, unfair prohibitions on publishing, and funding of their research, employment insecurity, physical threats, and physical attacks.**

○ All four are misconstrued or false in some way or another

○ Claim 1: “Hereditarians are thus left with the improbable position that their work is stifled and difficult to publish while simultaneously claiming they have established firm conclusions and achieved wide acceptance.”

■ [Cofnas 20](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09515089.2019.1697803), [Meisenburg 19](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.mdpi.com/2624-8611/1/1/21), and others would claim hereditarian research is being stifled or is more difficult to publish while also claiming “that their position on race differences in intelligence is strongly and widely supported by others in the field.”

■ They would cite [Snyderman 88](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.amazon.com/IQ-Controversy-Media-Public-Policy/dp/0887388396) or [Rindermann’s surveys](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289619301886) to prove that their claims are accepted by the academic community but cite anecdotal evidence for the difficulty of publishing their work due to “Equalitarian Dogma” (as seen in [Clark & Winegard 20](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338754119_Tribalism_in_War_and_Peace_The_Nature_and_Evolution_of_Ideological_Epistemology_and_Its_Significance_for_Modern_Social_Science))

■ Even so, these surveys are abundant with issues including taking opinions of researchers from different fields, only hereditarian researchers at times, and low response rates

■ If anything, there is a publication leniency, (as seen in [Panofsky 14](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://academic.oup.com/sf/article/94/4/e111/2461415)) that hereditarian publishing is tolerated as controversy generates publicity

○ Claim 2: “Claims about media coverage require empirical evidence but hereditarians seldom provide any (e.g., Jensen quoted in Miele, 2002, p. 79; [Woodley of Menie et al., 2018](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289618300837?via%3Dihub)). In the well-established field of science communication, judging the accuracy of media coverage of science requires longitudinal and comparative studies based on a wide range of resources” (Random quotes from[ Rushton & Jensen](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://philipperushton.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/James-Watsons-Most-Inconvenient-Truth-Race-Realism-and-the-Moralistic-Fallacy-2008-by-John-Philippe-Rushton-Arthur-Robert-Jensen.pdf) about the media with no backing is not sufficient)

○ Claim 3: While researchers in the past may have faced more repetitive and common harassment, this does not occur after publishing of *The Bell Curve* by Murray & Hernstein

■ Jensen himself said before his death that besides one 1999 incident, harassment against him had stopped

■ [Carl and Woodley of Menie (2019)](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289619301795?via%3Dihub) attempt to document “controversies” in intelligence research but things to note:

● “First, they do not report on the field of intelligence research, but only the much smaller field of research that focuses on race or gender differences in intelligence”

● . Second, they “decided not to exclude incidents just because the person concerned was not an intelligence researcher per se” (Carl & Woodley of Menie, 2019, p. 1), thus, they include people who have never researched intelligence.

● Third, they only include people who advocate the hereditarian position on race/gender and IQ; anyone opposing that position is not listed even if they were involved in a controversy; thus Jensen is listed as being involved in “controversies,” but none of his intellectual opponents are listed, although logically they must have been as involved as Jensen was.

■ Of the incidents reported by Carl and Woodley of Menie (2019), there are six physical “threats” listed since 1995, some of which are poorly documented (such as against that of Nijenhuis) and include protests against Charles Murray **who is not a hereditarian researcher but a conservative writer using hereditarianism to justify his own racist beliefs** (even then, the protests at universities, for example, resulted in the students being reprimanded and Murray being invited again)

■ “The point is not to engage in some sort of scorekeeping about which side of the issue has suffered the most but rather to point out that hereditarians who may face harassment do not do so because only one side of racial issues is “allowed” to be discussed publicly.” (if this claim by hereditarians were the case then we would not see a rise in right wing violence against antiracist and feminist teachers ([Lieberman, 2017](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/21/us/university-professors-free-speech-online-hate-threats/index.html))

○ Claim 4a: Unfair Denouncements

■ From Panofsky 14:

■ “swaggering, aggressive disposition was more than a way to weather protests. It animated an approach to building the symbolic and material resources for securing scientific credibility and recognition, or scientific capital. For these behavior geneticists, the task was . . . to engage in polemical scientific attack, declaring themselves as crusaders who would rout the antigenetics heresy gripping behavioral science (p. 141). Pearson’s character assassinations suited this crusade perfectly.”

■ In sum, while claiming to be victims of “unfair denouncements”, hereditarians such as Pearson and Sesardic often call those who disagree with their positions “Leftists” and “Marxists” ([Pearson 1991](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.gwern.net/docs/iq/1991-pearson-raceintelligencebiasinacademe.pdf); [Sesardic 05](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://lesacreduprintemps19.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/making-sense-of-heritability-neven-sesardic.pdf%23page=48) ; Taberny 15 (in the sesardic section of the SL)

■ Also: “Hereditarians cannot reasonably claim that there is a taboo on objective, value-free scientific research and simultaneously make alliances with, cite as authorities, and publish under the auspices of the most extreme-right racist figures on the political landscape. Nor can they justify attacking their critics as issuing fallacious ad hominem arguments by pointing out these connections.” (as we see in Carl & Woodley 19 where they defend Nijenhuis against attacks of his involvement in “neo-fascist” organizations)

○ Claim 4b: Loss of Jobs

■ Once again, Carl & Woodley cite:

● “8 individuals lost full-time jobs or temporary positions . . . : Noah Carl, Frank Ellis, Gerhard Meisenberg, Bryan Pesta, Jason Richwine, Alessandro Sturmia, Larry Summers, and James Watson. In addition, three other individuals lost work at least in part because of a “communication” related to psychometric intelligence. (Christopher Brand, Toby Young and Thilo Sarrazin; p. 2)” (from Carl & Woodley 19)

■ They misconstrued the context of each firing and even cite nonscientists (see full study)

○ Finally, while there certainly is no movement to silence hereditarians through the means listed above, :

■ “...there is a substantial scholarly literature that is almost never discussed or cited. We refer to the five decades of careful, archival investigations documenting the involvement of psychologists and the Pioneer Fund with the campaign to overturn the Brown decision and preserve segregation, anti-immigration activism, and active involvement with neo-Nazi groups (Billig, 1979; J. P. Jackson, 2005; Lombardo, 2002, 2003; Newby, 1969; Saini, 2019; Tucker, 1994, 2002, 2003, 2009; Winston, 1998)”

Rushton didn’t inform the students that the survey hadn’t been approved by the university, and many students likely felt pressured to participate so as to not offend their professor.

■ **Example: China**

● “*He does, for example, spend considerable time and space acknowledging the contribution of China to world science and culture. But, in the end, the Chinese contribution is considered inferior to that of the West. Why? Basically, the Chinese were never able to measure their science in terms of a “framework that would enable the accumulation of scientific knowledge.*” (Roberts 04 [pg. 59])

● Murray does not account for certain characteristics of China that are only relevant with western science. One of these was the effective use of long distance communication. China was for most of its history a vast isolated country, divided into numerous districts and provinces, each having its own forms of governance. Communication was thus not in any way uniform or, in many cases, even existent. That a scientist working in Western China, let alone a lay-person, would know of, record, or comment upon the discovery of another scientist working in an eastern province was highly unlikely

■ **Now it is clear that without frameworks, Murray does not count the achievements of certain civilization’s achievements. This is shown in his limited coverage of Africa: Murray claims the African Art was merely decorative or functional, and so excludes it.**

● “*Of course, the claim—that Africans merely produced “functional objects”—is patently false: they produced structurally complex and aesthetically striking art objects, including both conventional and monumental sculptures, and numerous other purely aesthetic items that profoundly influenced Western European art from the mid-nineteenth century onward. But to maintain the exclusivity and centrality of “objective standards” for assessing accomplishment, Murray must regard all of African art as devoted to creating basic utensils, just a knife and fork kind of culture, and therefore entirely lacking the intellectual “framework” necessary for cultural accomplishment.*” (Roberts 04 [pg. 60])

■ **“Oh, but 97% of inventions were invented by white Europeans!” This statistic was, once again, blatantly misconstrued by Murray.**

● “*First of all, Murray attributes absolute statistical certainty regarding European and North American accomplishment to his own compilation of scientific inventories. As we have seen, his compilation is biased from the outset, secreting a long-standing predisposition about race, sex, class and achievement. Moreover, as Judith Shulevitz, in her New York Times review of Human Accomplishment correctly argues, written scientific inventories were infinitely more common to Europe and North America than to China, the Far East in general, Africa, the Mideast, South America, or the various island civilizations. 15. And to argue, as Murray does, that the fact that inventories did not exist indicates that accomplishment in the arts and sciences in non-European cultures was meager, is patently absurd. The only reasonable conclusion that one can draw from the fact that inventories do not exist is that inventories were either lost, unaccounted for, or, more likely, were just not made. In short, the non-existence of a collection of biographical entries says virtually nothing about whether important scientific and artistic contributions existed in a given civilization.*” (Roberts 04 [pg. 61]).

● **Overall Use of Statistic:** “*The conservative penchant for the inevitability of absolute—read, white male— authority is also addressed in Human Accomplishment. In this regard Murray pays special attention to the extreme differences between ordinary mortals and the 4,002 recorded geniuses, even going so far as to quote a passage that compares the ordinary with worms in face of some of these remarkable men. These giants, Murray argues, are the result of a “magnificent inequality” that is wholly quantifiable, and therefore an indisputable fact. But the “magnificent inequality” is wholly the invention of Murray, and, in this case, used as a means of justifying a set of social relations, which, in reality, are infinitely more complex than Murray leads us to believe. Social and intellectual ranking are largely the result of extraordinarily intricate socioeconomic, political, cultural, and historical conditions and relations, not the stipulations of conservative ideology. Moreover, one just might not feel worm-like or have the irresistible urge to prostrate oneself before such giants as Alfonso X of Castile, Karl L. Immerman, Antonis Mor van Dashorst, William McCune or C. H. D. Buys-Ballot, earth scientist.*”

● **Neven Sesardić**

Also Hochman 2018 posted later continues the argument in favor of “popping” race instead of deflating it as Spencer supports)

○ [Hochman 13b](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://philarchive.org/archive/HOCRDH)

■ *“In this paper I argue that Sesardic equivocates between two versions of racial naturalism: a weak version and a strong version. As I shall argue, the strong version is not supported by the relevant science. The weak version, on the other hand, does not contrast properly with what social constructionists think about ‘race’. By leaning on this weak view Sesardic’s racial naturalism intermittently gains an appearance of plausibility, but this view is too weak to revive racial naturalism”*

■ Points out the flaws in Sesardic’s argument that Lewontin’s marxist views undermine the latter’s thesis

● *“What I refuse to take seriously is the possibility that Lewontin’s politics explain why Hogben (who was not a Marxist) made the same arguments concerning the importance of interaction three decades before Lewontin, or why Moffitt and Caspi (who are not Marxists) continue to make the same arguments concerning the importance of interaction three decades after Lewontin. If Sesardic wants to offer up political bias as an alternative hypothesis for the persistence of the interaction debates, then further documentation of Lewontin’s politics is just a distraction; in contrast, he must show how the same political biases shaped the varied advocates of interaction across the three controversies.”*

● Hereditarians want to achieve: High WGH, together with some collateral empirical information, inductively establishes a non-zero BGH.

● [Mackenzie 1980](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01066273), [Mackenzie 1984](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8fd5/bc2c0da82792d5fc32e03a5e8791b5181c35.pdf)

■ Further, Jensen constructs a strawman:

● “Many researchers who are primarily interested in environmental differences associated with racial and ethnic differences in intelligence would not be at all perturbed by an ironclad demonstration that, say, 3% of the [black-white] gap is due to genetic differences.” – Earl Hunt, Human Intelligence. (2010). Cambridge University Press. pp. 434-435.

● The data that sesardic presents to portray nonzero BGH is not the same as the 0.5 or .8 argued by Jensen, Rushton and Lynn. The burden falls on them to prove HIGH BGH not simply nonzero so that scientists entertaining the idea of IQ differences as a result of genetics at some negligible number are not painted as hereditarians

Some basic arguments, outlined [better citation needed since I stole this from someone]:

\1. The six week cutoff is entirely nonsensical, and not based in science

a. The “heartbeat” detected at six weeks is not actually a heart

b. “It’s not a fully formed heart… we can see it on the ultrasound, but it’s not a heart, a fully developed organ, by any means” - Dr. Rebecca Cohen, a professor at the University of Colorado

c. In fact, at six weeks, it’s still an embryo - not even an actual fetus

\2. The legislation in Alabama in particular is specifically and blatantly about controlling women

a. Repbulican Clyde Chambliss, in response to the argument that fertilization clinics actually dispose of more fertilized eggs than abortion clinics, said that “The egg in the lab doesn’t apply. It’s not in a woman. She’s not pregnant.”

\3. Many anti-abortion lawmakers have demonstrated how little they understand the topic.

a. MO Rep. Todd Atkin believes that women cannot be impregnated through rape

b. TX Rep. Michael Burgess once argued that abortion should be banned at 15 weeks, because that’s when fetuses are capable of masturbation

i. [https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/06/michael-burgess-fetus-masturbation/314146/](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/06/michael-burgess-fetus-masturbation/314146/)

c. President Trump himself claimed that doctors often execute babies shortly after birth

\4. It’s now highly possible that if a woman seeks option after being raped, she will be jailed for a longer time than her rapist

a. In Alabama, abortion is a Class A felony, punishable by a minumum of ten years in prison.

b. Rape and incest are Class C felonies, punishable by a maximum of ten years in prison

\5. There are proven ways to reduce abortion - a ban on abortion isn’t the only route

a. A report from the Guttmacher Institute found that countries with “robust women’s rights protections, liberal abortion laws, and easily accessible birth control… have some of the lowest abortion rates in the world.”

i. [Guttmacher Institute: Boonstra et al. 2006](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/report_pdf/aiwl.pdf).

\1. “The **U.S. abortion rate began to fall after 1980**, dropping more steeply after 1990 until it reached a rate of 21 abortions per 1,000 women in 2002—the lowest since 1974. Although the abortion rate among married women remained consistently low between 1981 and 2000, the rate for unmarried women fell sharply, from 50 per 1,000 women in 1981 to 34 in 2000 (Figure 3.3, page 17). A key factor behind this trend was increased contraceptive use... Thus, **the increase in contraceptive use contributed significantly to the decrease in abortion rates** among unmarried women.”

\6. Well over 130 health and human rights organizations, led by the ACLU, have written to Congress to defend Planned Parenthood

a. The American College of Obstericians and Gynecologists, the largest group of reproductive health doctors in the U.S, is strongly pro-choice in its official statements.

# **Gender Wage/Income Gap**
**While many studies manage to adjust for major factors in wage differences, there are too many minor factors to create a truly accurate picture and many major factors are directly detrimental to women's ability to increase their income.**

● [CONSAD Research Corporation](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/public-policy/hr-public-policy-issues/Documents/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf)

○ Report prepared for US Department of Labor

○ **After adjusting for major factors, the report only manages to lower the gender wage gap to an area between 4.8% and 7.1%** using available data, acknowledging that there are too many minor factors to consider so it's hard to get a more exact answer

■ Factors isolated: occupation, human capital development, work experience, career interruptions, motherhood, industry, health insurance, other fringe benefits, overtime work

○ To be taken from the study in this context: Of the major factors which are isolated, **some of them (career interruptions, motherhood) are particularly detrimental for women compared to men**; controlling for these particular factors is similar to controlling for discrimination against women as those factors’ detriments specifically towards women are akin to the effect we’d see from actual discrimination

○ “*The adjusted pay is substantially smaller than the unadjusted pay gap, as the adjusted pay gap thus measures only overt workplace discrimination against women workers. This has led many conservatives and libertarians to denounce sexism being a factor behind the pay gap. However, this view ignores that the origins of the adjusted factors can be argued to be sexist in themselves, as they are theorized to be almost entirely the result of the different societal pressures on males and females, as well as the fact that mothers miss out on pay as the result of maternity leave.*”

# **False Rape Accusations**
**Rape reports are rarely false, and even stats like “2-10% are false” can still be put into more context. Much of this is credited to [this thorough reddit post](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/9hraly/fact_checking_false_rape_accusations_and_why_we/) by [u/LefthandedLunatic**](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.reddit.com/user/LefthandedLunatic/)**
## How many false rape accusations are there?
[Most experts agree](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/Publications_NSVRC_Overview_False-Reporting.pdf) that **false rape accusations make the total of 2-10% of the total accusations of rape**. Here’s a few relevant, widely cited studies on the subject:

● A multi-site study of eight U.S. communities including 2,059 cases of sexual assault found a **7.1% of false reports** [(Lonsway, Archambault, & Lisak, 2009](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/www.scirp.org/\(S\(i43dyn45teexjx455qlt3d2q\)\)/reference/ReferencesPapers.aspx?ReferenceID=1238871)).

● A study of 136 sexual assault cases in Boston from 1998-2007 found a **5.9% of false reports** ([Lisak et al., 2010](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21164210)).

● Using qualitative and quantitative analysis, researchers studied 812 reports of sexual assault from 2000-2003 and found a **2.1% of false reports** [(Heenan & Murray 2006)](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncjrs.gov/app/abstractdb/AbstractDBDetails.aspx?id=243182).

● [2017 Study into the FBI Database](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315728247_The_Prevalence_of_False_Allegations_of_Rape_in_the_United_States_from_2006-2010) found that between 2006 to 2010, the average number of **false rape accusations or baseless accusations was 5.55%**, and robbery had a similar false and baseless accusation rate at 5.76% ([see Table 1](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Crime-statistics-of-the-Uniform-Crime-Reporting-program-of-the-Federal-Bureau-of_tbl1_315728247))

● [A metastudy](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-015-0666-2) (those compile data from multiple studies) put the number of **False Rape Accusations at 5%**

2-10% seems rather common and enough to give anyone a pause considering how many false rape accusations that would mean once scaled up. But consider a few things.

\1. Only 1/3rd of sexual assaults are reported to police. So the false accusation number is 2-10% of that 33%.

\2. **1/3 x 1/10 = 0.03**

\3. **This means that only 3% of all rapes (those reported and not reported to the police) are false allegations**

When we consider just these 2 factors (total rapes and number reported), the stats around the subject change substantially.

Taking just these two factors into account, [this study from 2010](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1077801210387749) says that “Although false allegations are 5% of all rapes reported to the police, the fact that at least 90% of rapes are never reported to the police (not just including college samples, and this is a conservative estimate) suggests that **of all rapes (those reported and not reported to the police), 0.005% are false allegations**.” While this study does assume a non-reported rate of 90% rather than 66%, it still really shows how much the stats can change by factoring these numbers in at all.
## How many falsely accused are jailed?
The answer is very low.

● [National Registry of Exoneration](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/browse.aspx) who keeps track of how many innocent people have been exonerated, and it found that since 1989 in the US, 52 people have been exonerated for sexual assault that they didn't do. For comparison, 790 people were exonerated on false accusations of murder.

● [British Home Office](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100408125722/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/hors293.pdf) did a detailed study and report on the issues of false rape accusations in 2005 and found that out of the 216 cases of rape that was false in the UK, 126 of them have a formal complain filed by the accuser, 39 of them had a named suspect and only 6 of them were arrested. Out of the 6 arrested, only 2 have charges and 0 of them had a conviction.

● [A study by the University of Pittsburgh](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://search.proquest.com/docview/1900298026?pq-origsite=gscholar) found that only 18% of false rape accusations even name a suspect.

The fact of the matter is that **the majority of false rape accusations don't even name a suspect**. And throwing this into the picture of the total of the numbers of rape really proves how rare false rape Convictions are. Vast majority of false rape accusers always accuse a non existent stranger who raped them and usually not someone specifically. Which means that beyond wasting time and resources majority of false rape accusations are harmless to the general public because no one person is accused.

**When you take these numbers and add them to what we already know about rape, a more complete picture forms**:

\1. **1/6** women claim to have experience sexual assault, follow by a **1/3** reporting the assault to police, then worst case scenario **1/10** are false. Out of those false rape accusations **18/100** name a suspect, out of false rape accusations that accuse someone **15/100** get an arrest, and out of those who are arrested only **1/3** have charges placed against them.

\2. **So 1/6 x 1/3 x 1/10 x 18/100 x 15/100 x 1/3 = 0.00005**

\3. This means out of all the women you meet, **you have a 0.005% chance of being falsely charged of rape**.

Compare this to the fact that [6.4% of men openly admitted of committing the strictest possible definition of rape](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://time.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/repeatrapeinundetectedrapists.pdf) (and 23% of that 6.4% admitted to multiple rapes) or the fact that [men are more likely to be raped than falsely accused of rape](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/factcheck-men-are-more-likely-to-be-raped-than-be-falsely-accused-of-rape). Maybe people alleging a false accusation epidemic are focusing on the wrong problems here.
## Why do false accusations happen?
**Please note that this subsection in its current form sucks and really needs revisiting**

Many people who fear false rape accusations claim that women in the workforce will make a false accusation against a man in a higher position, or a student who is going to fail an exam will accuse a professor, or that a vengeful ex makes a false accusation, or a woman who regretted sex later. But the reality of this is very surprising.

● [A review done by the LAPD](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/237582.pdf) found the reasons for a false rape accusations is unwanted pregnancies or more commonly "missed curfews" by young teenagers. It turns out that 55% of False Rape Accusations according to this review are for hope of getting medical care or psychiatric medication by the very poor and destitute

● [Also it is noted that half of the false accusations are made by parents of children](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/www.d.umn.edu/cla/faculty/jhamlin/3925/4925HomeComputer/Rape%20myths/Police.pdf), either by pressuring the child to go to the police or accusing someone of rape without the child knowing. It is also important to note that the rare Serial False Rape Accusers tend to have a history of being a legitimate victim of sexual abuse as a child.

As this shows that the majority of the time, **false accusers aren't the serial accusers we hear on the media nor are in tech jobs, nor college students who regret sex**. Instead it is usually either the very poor looking for free medication, teenagers trying to get out of trouble and parents of children.

Also there are no correlations with the age of the accusation or the number of sexual partners of the accuser and whether their accusations are true or not. Add this to the fact that [most legitimate victims lie to themselves and others saying that they weren't sexually assaulted when they really were. This denial often is due to the fact that the majority of victims know their abusers personally before the assault and often change their stories or denied that they were as a way to cope with the trauma.](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0886260517726412?casa_token=TR0lDTFQ-9cAAAAA:XFQbcARRx9QC1UnefnGp3FIc0pMTR4K5X-49EvzFMnXxeQxUba98DKlj4DcWjJOvFeihHXQTGwd5Vw&)

○ “[Our] data show[s] consistently across seven studies that individuals’ outgroup attitudes are more positive when living in social contexts in which people have, on average, more positive intergroup contact. Moreover, we found a consistent contextual effect of contact on prejudice in each study: indeed, the effect of intergroup contact between social contexts is greater than the effect of individual-level contact within contexts. In four studies we provided evidence that this contextual effect is accompanied by more tolerant social norms that possibly explain the larger effect of intergroup contact on the social-context level of analysis. **Thus, positive intergroup contact is associated with reduced prejudice on a macro- and not merely [micro level], whereby people are influenced by the behavior of others in their wider social context**” (Christ et al… [pg. 4]).

○ immigrants are twice as likely to become entrepreneurs and that number is going up. A quarter of engineering and technology companies started in the United States between 2006–2012  had at least one key founder who was an immigrant. Immigrant startups hire over 500,000 in America and they generated $63 billion in sales in 2012. Immigrant founders from top venture-backed firms have created an average of approximately 150 jobs per company in the United States

# **Jobs and Wages**
**Immigrants are a necessary component of the job market and entrepreneurship. Low-skill immigrants only sometimes cause minor depressions in the wages of low-skill native workers (those without high school diploma) and other low-skill immigrants, yet even in these cases, wage depressions are very small.**

We estimate 24% of entrepreneurs in these states from 1995-2008 are immigrants, which broadly corresponds with other studies. As important, this immigrant entrepreneurship share [rose] from 17% in 1995 to 27% in 2008” (*Kerr & Kerr 16 [pg. 2]).

○ When measured over a period of 10 years or more, **the impact of immigration on the wages of native-born workers overall is very small**. To the extent that negative impacts occur, they are most likely to be found for prior immigrants or native-born workers who have not completed high school—who are often the closest substitutes for immigrant workers with low skills.

○ **There is little evidence that immigration significantly affects the overall employment levels of native-born workers**. As with wage impacts, there is some evidence that recent immigrants reduce the employment rate of prior immigrants. In addition, recent research finds that immigration reduces the number of hours worked by native teens (but not their employment levels).

○ Immigration has an overall positive impact on long-run economic growth in the U.S.

○ Finds that when the Department of Labor reported over the four year period following legalization (1988-1992) of undocumented immigrants, that **the mean hourly wages of the general U.S. worker grew by 15%. (16.1% for the mean hourly wage of a U.S. citizen worker)**

○ Keep in mind, that legalization occurred at the same time in a period when the U.S. unemployment rate rose from 5.3% to 7.5%

○ “Almost immediately, **IRCA-based legalization had the effect of giving rights to more workers, raising the low wage floor of the economy, reducing the demand for easily exploitable immigrants, and reducing illegal crossings and apprehensions**.

○ In terms of fiscal impacts, first-generation immigrants are more costly to governments, mainly at the state and local levels, than are the native-born, in large part due to the costs of educating their children. However, as adults, **the children of immigrants (the second generation) are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the U.S. population, contributing more in taxes than either their parents or the rest of the native-born population**.

○ Over the long term, the impacts of immigrants on government budgets are generally positive at the federal level but remain negative at the state and local level — but these generalizations are subject to a number of important assumptions. Immigration’s fiscal effects vary tremendously across states.

Since gang members seldom have travel documents, authorities cannot prove an individual is not from the country he declares as his point of origin. **Some of the deportations are reported to be deliberately planned as a way for a selected MS-­‐13 member to obtain a ‘free ride’ to a specific country**.” Through targeting deportations, the gang is able to deepen their influence through gathering more recruits and resources across countries, only later to come back to the US even bigger than before, and a vicious cycle is born.

● The 2000s increase in immigration flow into Western European countries is used to assess whether immigration affects crime victimization and the perception of criminality among European natives.

● Using data from the European Social Survey, the Labour Force Survey and other sources, a set of fixed effects and instrumental variable estimations are provided that deal with the endogenous sorting of immigration by region and with the sampling error in survey-based measures of regional immigration shares, whose implications in terms of attenuation bias are investigated by means of [Monte Carlo](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/montecarlosimulation.asp) simulations.

● Empirical findings show that an **increase** in immigration **does not** affect crime **victimization**, but is **associated** with an increase in the **fear of crime**. This is also positively correlated with native populations’ negative perceptions of immigrants.

● Reveals a misconception that native Europeans hold of the link between crime and immigrants, which isn’t supported.

● According to the new 2016 Swedish police code, code 291 refers to crimes involving refugees. Police officers can insert the code whenever an asylum seeker is involved in a crime. **1% of police reports had this code.**

● Meanwhile, Sweden hosted 180,000 asylum seekers during this period, out of a population of 10 million. **This means that asylum seekers were 1.8% of the population**

● ***The data show that 55% (1799) of the 3,287 police reports (the 1% that involved refugees) filed took place at asylum-seeker accommodation facilities, while 159 were committed by outsiders, and so the majority of the incidents contained in these reports took place within asylum centers.***

● Violent crimes were greatly overrepresented among the reports filed within asylum centers, at **73%,** while only **30%** of reports outside of asylum centers involved violent crime

● Reports manually reviewed by swedish police investigators to filter out known errors, since reports are filed by police officers on the spot

● Quote from the swedish source which you can translate:

○ *“På en övergripande nivå kan det därför konstateras att det skett många incidenter på asylboenden, men sannolikt inte fler än i en motsvarande population i svenska samhället. Under 2015 kom en grupp som motsvarade 2% av Sveriges befolkning, dvs en väsentlig populationsökning som ledde till en ansenlig belastning på samhällets resurser. Samtidigt var enbart 1% av alla polisrelaterade händelser relaterade till flyktingkrisen, dvs något mindre än vad som skulle kunna antas. Sammanlagt kom över 160 000 asylsökande och för att sätta dessa siffror i ett mer förståeligt sammanhang så kan man tänka att om alla asylsökande från 2015 bildade en stad hade den staden varit Sveriges fjärde största, efter Stockholm, Göteborg och Malmö.”*

● For males, they are able to explain between half and three-quarters of the gap in crime by reference to only 2 socioeconomic factors, parental socio-economic resources, and neighborhood segregation

● For females, they can explain even more, sometimes the entire gap using only these 2 factors

● In addition, they tentatively examine the role of co-nationality or culture by comparing the crime rates of randomly chosen pairs of individuals originating from the same country. They find only a small correlation in the crime of individuals who share the same origin, indicating that culture is unlikely to be a strong cause of crime among immigrants

● **Dutch longitudinal study** of asylum seekers and their impact on crime in neighborhoods in **2005, 2010** and **2015 (last year counts the height of the refugee crisis)**

● English summary at page 59

● Finds that when you **account for socio-economic position, gender and age**, asylum seekers, and their children, commit **LESS crime** in the Netherlands per capita in **all three years**. It also shows that when you make it easier for those asylum seekers to get **residence permits**, they actually commit **LESS crime than when you make it harder**. This is also present in the data shown, which shows that of the countries shown, migrants from countries which have easier residence permits (Syria and Eritrea) commit less crime than those of safer countries.

● Results mirror what we see in [the studies from Italy](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TrLqG-EDiNGmKa5Ued3bqY6bd0qozXBGahvPMcGnFXM/edit%23bookmark=id.58eaqr9vp76s): Legal immigrants commit less crime than illegal ones, because they have a shot at citizenship, so they don't turn to crime.

[Ethnicity and Crime in the Netherlands: James D. Unnever 18](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324489385_Ethnicity_and_Crime_in_the_Netherlands)

● **META-ANALYSIS** on immigrant crime in the Netherlands

● Some studies show that ethnic minorities, **including Moroccans and Turks**, are **less likely** to commit crimes than the **native Dutch**. Other research indicates that ethnic minorities are more likely to commit crimes than the native Dutch. The research is also unclear as to whether there are **gender differences**.

○ Studies which show less crime by minorities are cross-sectional and longitudinal self-report studies, and there is evidence minorities self-report less. However, research which shows minorities commit more crime is police data, and police data is confounded by likely police discrimination, which varies between even different ethnic minorities.

● Some studies suggest that **native Dutch females are more likely** than ethnic minority females to commit crimes,while other research indicates that immigrant females are more likely than the native Dutch females to engage in crimes.

● Additionally, there are studies that indicate **similarly situated individuals**, regardless of whether they belong to an **ethnic group** or are **native Dutch**, have the **same likelihood of committing crimes**. In other words, the reason why immigrants have a greater probability of being arrested is because they are **disproportionately exposed to crime-related factors** such as being of a **lower socioeconomic status** and being younger and more often male than the average native Dutch person.

● The authors studied the degree to which various ethnic groups are represented in various types of officially registered criminal offenses and the degree to which the chance of being a suspect in specific types of crimes can be explained by demographic and socio-economic background characteristics of the person in question.

● The results show that there are clear differences among ethnic groups with respect to the relative share of various types of criminal offenses. Only a **small part** of the differences relate to ethnic origin; **demographic and socio-economic background characteristics play a more important role**.

● A large part of the explanation might be found in personal factors, coincidental circumstances or background characteristics not included in the model.
## Germany


[Thomas Feltes, Katrin List, and Maximilian Bertamini 18: Ruhr-University Bochum](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325480186_More_Refugees_More_Offenders_More_Crime_Critical_Comments_with_Data_from_Germany)

● Assesses the topic of correlations between increasing refugee numbers and crime statistics based on data collected during the migration of more than one million refugees to Germany in 2015 and 2016.

● The ﬁrst part is about the difﬁculties of comparing crime rates of nationals (in this case Germans) to those of non-nationals for various reasons, including registration and especially due to certain prevailing social factors and circumstances, such as gender and age.

● Finds that while crime is falling, citizens perceive crime to be rising, and analyses said paradox.

● Analyses crimes committed against non-nationals.

● Shows that the surplus of crime is mainly a result of the composition of the migrants (young, single males) and that most of the offenses committed are nonviolent offenses

● Estimates that most of the **violent offenses have been committed between migrants and in the context of refugee housing or shelters.**

● Many crimes related to being an asylum seeker (such as being unregistered) that **can’t be** **committed by natives drive up the numbers artificially**

● The authors write:

○ *“But while more (primary male and young) refugees “produce”—for obvious statistical reasons—more offenders and more crime, the victimization of migrants and refugees as a result of their “journey”is often neglected by the public, politicians, and the media. We have also shown that the surplus of crime is mainly a result of the composition of the migrants (young, single males) and that most of the offenses committed are nonviolent offenses.”*

○ *“If one would attribute the increase in crime that was observed in 2015 entirely to the refugees that entered Germany in this year, this would lead to a rate of suspects per 100.00 (Tatverd chtigenbelastungszahl, TVBZ) of 5800 for this group of refugees. This rate for Germans was 2124. Hence, the rate for refugees would be considerably higher than the rate for the Germans. But if we take a closer look at the rate of Germans aged between 16 and 30 (which is the age group most closely to that of refugees), one comes to another conclusion. **Here, the rate for Germans ranges between 4200 and 5800, so absolutely in the range that is calculated (though inadequately) when observing refugees only.** If we apply these numbers to those offenses that seem to matter most to the public (such as burglaries and sexual assaults), then the increase of non-German suspects (and especially of refugees) is considerably lower than one would initially have expected.”*

● **Interpretation**: This means that most of the actual consequences of the crimes have fallen on other asylum seekers, meaning the crime burden on the native population is smaller than for a native citizen per capita. This is in addition to their suspect numbers not being higher.

● **MASSIVE STUDY** on the effects of immigration on the labor market for natives and former immigrants, unemployment, crime, which factors played a role, as well as the effects of immigration on attitudes and voting patterns. We will deal with the crime aspects here, [click here for the economic ones](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TrLqG-EDiNGmKa5Ued3bqY6bd0qozXBGahvPMcGnFXM/edit%23bookmark=id.9oay2d2gl90z), and [here for the attitudes](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TrLqG-EDiNGmKa5Ued3bqY6bd0qozXBGahvPMcGnFXM/edit%23bookmark=kix.3xfzfddm4l93)

● Within states, migrants were allocated to counties based on reasons unrelated to local labor market conditions or crime levels.

● Housing vacancies are not significant determinants of refugee allocations, although it remains conceivable that the availability of estates that can house a large amount of refugees all in one place, e.g. abandoned barracks, is a predictor.

● Suggests that - with the obvious exception of violations to right-of-residence and asylum laws - there is **no association** between the number of refugees and the number of street crimes in Germany.

● However, a statistically significant relationship between bigger reception centers and drug crimes and fare-dodging is found, as well as the number of non-German suspects in relation to these crimes. This might partly be driven by higher alertness of police in these counties. The idea that crime rates in reception centers are higher is supported by other studies.

○ **Solution:** This indicates that spreading out refugees across the country is better than concentrating them. This can be done by filling housing vacancies. Also, legalization of drugs and treatment of addicts would destroy that black market.

● **VERY LARGE STUDY** on victimization rates of natives by refugees

● Results **do not support the view that Germans were victimized in greater numbers by refugees as measured by their rate of victimization in crimes with refugee suspects.**

● Finds evidence that the overall victimization rate (that is, **when crime by natives and crimes against refugees are included**) has a hump-shape relationship with the scale of refugee immigration when using non-linear regression, however finds no statistically significant difference between 2014 and 2015 with two types of linear regression

● Finds that decentralized accommodation of refugees, at given levels of refugee immigration to a county, tends to reduce the overall crime rate in a county (while refugee sex ratios exert no effect).

● **Finds no evidence that the victimization rate of native germans is increased with refugee arrival, regardless of scale, type of housing accommodation of refugees or gender composition. That is, crimes committed against Germans in which refugees are suspects do not increase the victimization rates of native germans.**

○ *“**Our** **results do not support the view that Germans were victimized in greater numbers by refugees as measured by their rate of victimization in crimes with refugee suspects.”***

● **These results hold true not only for total victimization of natives by refugees but also sub-groups of crimes like economic crimes, violent crimes and sexual crimes (rape and sexual assault).**

● Key findings corroborated in various **robustness checks**, including the **measurement of victimization outcomes in 2016 (rather than 2015)** and the use of IV regressions that exploit for identification information on the 2014 pre-crisis location of refugee reception centers and their aerial distance to population-weighted centroids of counties located within the same federal state.

● Conclusions drawn from the study: since there is no link in the victimization rate of germans and refugee arrival regardless of housing accommodation, and decentralized housing accomodation for refugees reduces crime, the view that segregated communities and refugee centers increase crime by refugees against other refugees increased, while policies to further integrate the refugee population reduce the overall crime rate

● Quote: *“Above all, however, studies in both bodies of literature suffer from a basic but fundamental shortcoming which has received little, if any, attention to date. They standardly make use of but **crude crime** or **victimization rates** in their analyses, that is **crimes and victims per capita**, or variants thereof, but **never of actual rates of victimization of natives by refugees or foreigners**. This drawback weighs heavily, for crude crime and victimization rates are only a very imperfect measure of the latter, including in their count also crimes confined to foreigners (crimes by and against foreigners), crimes confined to natives (crimes by and against natives), and crimes in which foreigners are victimized by natives (crimes by natives against foreigners), which includes even hate or anti-foreigner crimes. As each of these crimes may vary in its prevalence systematically with the level of immigration, crude crime and victimization rates are rather inappropriate for investigating whether natives are harmed by immigration. In fact, as we will show, their use can lead to seriously biased inference.”*

● Methodology:

○ *“The first data set comprises detailed, high-quality statistics on the regional distribution of refugees, their gender composition, age structure, and type of accommodation (decentralized or centralized, i.e. in group quarters), prior to and after the mass inflow of refugees in the latter part of 2015. This data set has been constructed from special data extracts drawn from the Statistic on Asylum Seekers’ Benefits (SASB) (“Asylbewerberleistungsstatistik”), an administrative public registry with full coverage of all refugees who seek asylum and receive such benefits in Germany”*

○ **Second data set:** *“Our special data extracts from the SASB allow us to study also compositional features of regional refugee populations, such as their gender composition and accommodation structure.”*

● The paper analyses the empirical relationship between immigrants and crime using panel data for 391 German administrative districts between 2003 and 2016 (which is within the syrian refugee crisis of 2015).

● Shows no positive association between the immigrant rate and the crime rate.

● Methodology:

○ *“We assess the robustness of this result by considering the heterogeneity of immigrant groups with respect to gender, age, country of origin and – if applicable – refugee status, and study naturalized immigrants. We also take into account possible spillover effects of immigrants on criminal activities by Germans, omitted variables and spatial correlation. Furthermore, taking advantage of the panel-structure of the data set we employ an instrumental variable approach that deals with the possibly endogenous allocation of immigrants and allows for causal interpretation of the estimates.”*

● According to a 2017 study in the European Journal of Criminology, the crime rate was higher among immigrant youths than native youths during the 1990s and 2000s but most of the difference could be explained by socioeconomic factors.

● The different crime rates narrowed in the last ten years; the study speculates that "a **new citizenship law finally granting German-born descendants of guest workers German citizenship**, as well as **increased integration efforts (particularly in schools)** and a stronger **disapproval of violence**" may have contributed to this narrowing.

● **Longitudinal study covering 40 years** of immigration into the UK

● Uses **both official reported crime and self-reported victimization data**

● **Strong and consistent evidence** that enclaves have lower crime experiences than otherwise observably similar neighbourhoods that have a lower immigrant share of the population. This effect appears to be significant when we reach somewhere between **20-30%** immigrant share and is observed whether we use recorded crime data or self-reported crime victimisation data. The effect is present for both natives and immigrants, though it appears somewhat larger for immigrants.

● Finds that there is **no link** between immigrant population share and violent crimes like burglary, but that immigrants reduce antisocial behavior and non-violent crime.

● **Studies the individual-level relationship between immigration and property crime** in England and Wales using crime self-reports from the Crime and Justice Survey.

● Models that account for underreporting are used, since this is a major concern in crime self-reports.

● The results indicate that the reported crime is substantially underreported, but if anything, **immigrants are less likely to underreport than natives.**

● More importantly, controlling for underreporting and basic demographics, the estimates across all model specifications, although imprecise, indicate that **immigration status and property crime are negatively associated.**

● Also finds that the estimated relationship between immigration status and property crime differs across regions and ethnic groups.

● **Studies the link between crime and immigration** based on evidence from England and Wales in the 2000s.

● For studying immigration impacts, this period is of considerable interest as the composition of migration to the UK altered dramatically with the accession of Eastern European countries (the A8) to the European Union in 2004.

● Finds **no evidence** of an average **causal impact** of immigration on crime, nor when A8 and Non-A8 immigration are considered separately.

● Also studies London by itself as the immigration changes over time in the capital city were large. Again, **no causal impact of immigration on crime from spatial econometric analysis was found.** In addition, unique data on arrests of natives and immigrants in London also shows **no immigrant differences in the likelihood of being arrested.**

● Study explores the impact that the recent increase of immigration into the UK may have had on recorded crime levels.

● First, compares the **decrease in violent crime in cities with high levels of recent immigration with cities with relatively low immigration levels.** Second, explores **variations in recorded criminal involvement** amongst different immigrant groups living in different areas. Third, examines the data on antisocial behaviour and disorder noting that there is a **blurring of the distinction** between anti-social behaviour and crime at certain points. Fourth, **looks at the arrest data for Greater London in 2011.**

● Study uses said empirical evidence from England and Wales to suggest that, in contrast to the popular opinion that increased immigration is associated with an increase in crime, that **not only are the recent waves of immigration not linked to rising crime, but also that findings lend qualified support to the contention that recent waves of immigration have contributed to the crime drop that has taken place in the UK and other countries over the last two decades.**
## Italy


[Franco Pittau & Stefano Trasatti 09: Agenzia Redattore Sociale e Dossier statistico immigrazione Caritas/Migrantes](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.redattoresociale.it/article/la_criminalita_degli_immigrati_indagine_contro_corrente_) (Data is in Italian, use google translate)

● According to 2007 data, the crime rate of legal immigrants was **1.2–1.4%** whereas the crime rate was **0.8%** for native Italians.

● The overrepresentation is partly due to the large number of young legal immigrants, the crime rate is **1.9%** for legal immigrants aged 18–44 whereas it is **1.5%** for their Italian peers; **0.4%** for legal immigrants aged 45–64 years whereas it is **0.7%** for their Italian peers; and for those over 65 years old, the crime rates is the same among natives and foreigners.

● In fact, **if the age structure difference between natives and legal immigrants was accounted for,** the number of young italian natives would **increase**, and the **total italian native crime rate would increase to 1.02%.**

● **16.9%** of crimes committed by legal immigrants are also linked to violations of immigration laws, which natives can’t commit. By also excluding those crimes, the crime rate of legal immigrants is **largely the same as that of Italians with the same age structure,** at **1.03%**

● The study makes it known that, were it able to account for the **“unfavorable socioeconomic conditions”** of immigrants, **the balance would likely land on natives commiting more crime when that is taken into account.**

● [**With the subsequent decrease in crime between 2007-2016 of 65% among immigrants, while the decrease overall was only 25%, this would be an even better improvement for the picture of immigrant crime in Italy.**](https://archive.ph/uY9Yr#kix.13pfqhbapfd3)

● Best of the studies by Pinotti, since it counts two types of undocumented immigrants, much like Mastrobuoni and Pinotti (2014).

● Study on the effect of legalization on the crime rates of undocumented immigrants.

● Uses two study groups; former prison inmates and applicants for work permits. In spite of obvious differences in the two groups, a more than reduction in crime rates was seen in both.

○ Experiment 1: “The crime rate of Romanians and Bulgarians is identical to that of the other group in the months prior to the EU enlargement, but it decreases markedly after the enlargement. In particular, **close to 6 percent of pardoned inmates were re-arrested in both groups before the enlargement; this fraction drops to 2.3 percent for Romanians and Bulgarians after the enlargement, whereas there is no significant decline for the other group.** Therefore, the acquisition of legal status **cuts the probability of committing crimes by more than half in our sample of former prison inmates.”.** Specifically, **by 61.7%.**

○ Experiment 2: “I find that in the year after Click Days, **the crime rate decreases by half for immigrants who applied just before the permit cut-off date and had the application accepted, compared to immigrants who applied just after the cutoff and, therefore, had the application rejected.** In addition, I uncover an interesting heterogeneity by type of contract. In particular, **applicants sponsored by individuals and families for domestic work (e.g., caregivers) exhibit both a higher crime rate and a stronger response to legal status compared to applicants sponsored by firms.”**

● The study highlights the importance of access to the labor market as a vector for reducing crime, since it acts as an incentive to social behavior and a disincentive to criminal behavior.

● The study also finds that when it comes to work applicants, those who initially exhibit higher crime rates also exhibit a stronger crime reduction response to legalization.

● 2017 study analyzing the 2007 “Click days” legalization of undocumented immigrants in Italy

● **Finds that when legalized, the crime rates of legalized immigrants on average fell by 0.6 percentage points, from a baseline of 1.1%. This means their crime rates fell by 55%.**

[Paolo Pinotti et al. 13](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://web.archive.org/web/20160202205357/http://www.frdb.org/upload/file/Report%201.pdf)

● According to a 2013 report, undocumented immigrants are responsible for the **vast majority** of crimes committed in Italy by immigrants

● The share of undocumented immigrants varies between **60** and **70** percent for violent crimes, and it increases to **70–85 percent** for property crime.

● In 2009, the highest shares were in burglary (**85%**), car theft (**78%**), theft (**76%**), robbery (**75%**), assaulting public officers / resisting arrest (**75%**), handling stolen goods (**73%**)."

● Finds **that the 2007 “Click-day” reduced crime rates of all immigrants by 3.5% for every 10% increase in legalization (share of accepted applications) by region.** This translates into **35% if all applications are accepted. [A later study mentioned in this document shows that its direct effect on newly legalized immigrants is a ](https://archive.ph/uY9Yr#kix.fvee322sslqw)[**55% reduction** ](https://archive.ph/uY9Yr#kix.fvee322sslqw)[in crime](https://archive.ph/uY9Yr#kix.fvee322sslqw).**

● **Keep in mind,** not every undocumented immigrant necessarily sends an application, and the ones who don’t recieve a permit due to quotas are encouraged to do more crime, hiding a possibly larger potential effect from full legalization. Finally, simply having given them legal status from the start would have encouraged faster integration into the workforce and lowered crime rates, which can be adopted as a future policy.

● Prison population data may not give a reliable picture of immigrants' involvement in criminal activity due to different bail and sentencing decisions for foreigners. Foreigners are, for instance, far more overrepresented in the prison population than their share of convictions relative to the native population, indicating that they may be guilty of far less of these crimes.

● **Confirms that legalization of illegal immigrants in Italy would drastically reduce their crime rates**

● Focuses on Italy before and after the January 2007 European Union enlargement, finds that giving legal status to the previously illegal immigrants from the new EU member states led to a **"50 percent reduction in recidivism"**.

● The authors find that "legal status... explains **one-half to two-thirds** of the observed differences in crime rates between legal and illegal immigrants".

● According to an Italian study from 2013, **the majority of foreign prisoners are held in connection with a drug offence.**

● **One out of every nine offences** ascribed to foreign prisoners concerns violation of ‘laws governing foreigners’, which are specific to foreigners and hence should not be counted

● The 2013 study cites literature that points to discriminatory practices against foreigners by Italian law enforcement, judiciary and penal system.

● The majority of the 20 Italian regions plus the 2 autonomous provinces display a **lower** crime rate than their individual regional average of the previous ten years.

● The number of granted asylum permits in Italy follows the **opposite pattern**. Since the onset of the migration crisis in 2013, the share of people who have been granted asylum in the country has **increased** almost **exponentially**, from around **0.2** per **1000** people in 2007 to **1.6** per **1000** people in 2016

● The share of convicted foreigners is at an unprecedented all-time low. The average regional crime rate among foreigners has decreased by around **65% between 2007 and 2016.**

● French study on the crime rates of immigrants

● Finds that once immigrants’ economic circumstances are controlled for, the effect of the share of immigrants becomes insignificant, suggesting that immigrants are not ‘inherently’ more likely to commit crimes than the rest of the population. In addition,  results indicate that unemployed immigrants are more likely to commit crimes than unemployed nonimmigrants, because immigrants’ circumstances are more adverse. Hence, because unemployed immigrants tend to have less wealth to support them, lower education, and generally less accumulated capital or opportunities. Thus, policies that improve the economic circumstances of immigrants may go a long way to lowering crime rates.

● Secondly, documents that foreign outflows were very responsive to the crisis, as many immigrants left the country. **it argues that this dynamic relationship of immigrants coming and going from the country benefits Spanish natives.**

● Three years after the Great Recession, the unemployment rate of Spanish natives

● would have been **2.6 percentage points** higher in the absence of the pre-crisis immigration boom.

● Even though the effects of return-migration are unambiguously positive for natives, a key result of the quantitative analysis is that the job-creation effect of immigration is negative.

● However, the counterfactual exercise predicts that return-migration (**return of immigrants from Spain**) and match-separation effects (**Natives and immigrants working in different sectors**) are positive and **dominate** the aforementioned negative job-creation effect, since the jobs destroyed belonged to immigrants. This implies overall **welfare gains** for native workers.

● Infact, a decomposition analysis reveals that the return-migration channel is quantitatively the **most relevant** channel, since its short- and long-run impacts on the native unemployment rate are, respectively, 10 and 2 times as large as the sum of the impact of all the other channels.

● Argues that policies which restrict immigration **hurt** this labor **market flexibility** which has been shown to **help native workers.**

● Paper assesses how the immigration of refugees from the former Yugoslavia following the Balkan war in the early 1990s affected low-educated natives' real wages, employment and income mobility using Swedish longitudinal data

● This analysis coincided with a period of recession. Therefore, the paper uses difference-in-difference estimates to account for that with a control group.

Low-skilled native workers in **immigration-rich regions**, in contrast to immigration-poor regions, are **more likely** to experience **better income development**, **be in employment** and **change workplace** while also **moving upwards in the wage hierarchy** due to a labor supply shock caused by immigrants.

● A **short-lived** decline in wages for natives with competing skills, followed by an **increase in real wages,** and an **increase in employment** in immigration-rich areas, when compared to areas with **little immigration**.

● The movement effects are due to the impacts of complementarity and substitutability causing upgrades to a higher-wage job for low-skilled natives and movement to new jobs.

● Using **longitudinal** data on **ALL** workers in Denmark during the period 1991-2008, this study tracks the labor market outcomes of **low skilled natives** in response to an exogenous inflow of **low skilled immigrants.**

● Innovates on previous identification strategies by considering immigrants distributed across municipalities by a **refugee dispersal policy** in place between **1986** and **1998.**

● Finds that the increase in the supply of refugee-country immigrants **pushed less educated native workers** (especially the **young and low-tenured ones**) to pursue **less manual-intensive occupations.**

● As a result, immigration had **positive effects on native unskilled wages, employment and occupational mobility.**

● Only counts European Economic Area (EEA) migrant effects

● No evidence that European economic area (EEA) migration has increased unemployment on average, although there is a debate on whether unemployment is raised for low-skilled natives by a small margin

● Overall, no evidence that EEA migration has reduced wages for UK-born workers on average. Some evidence that migration has reduced earnings growth by a small amount for the low-skilled natives and raised it for the higher-skilled ones, but again these findings are subject to uncertainty.

● Possible adverse effects on low-skilled natives could be made up for by social programs, which become easier to fund through higher tax revenues from immigration and businesses employing immigrants

● Since English would be a 2nd language for most low-skilled immigrants, studies done in the US by Peri would also count here, and low-skilled natives and low-skilled immigrants would not be substitutable.

● Study on the **demand effects** of immigration to Germany from 2006-2019 using monthly administrative data for Germany.

● Provides empirical evidence suggesting that net migration flows can have **substantial demand effects.** Migration stimulates job openings, wages, house prices, investment, consumption, net exports, and output. Unemployment **falls** for natives overall (job-creation effect), driving a decline in total unemployment, while rising for foreigners (job-competition effect).

● Immigration as a whole in this period seems to have an average **neutral** effect on high-skilled natives, while **decreasing the unemployment rates** of **low** and **medium**-skilled natives, implying **low substitutability** between low and medium-skilled natives and foreigners.

● Immigration from **Syria** and **Africa**, which have a large proportion of **low-skilled immigrants**, has a **positive effect** on **low** and **medium**-skilled natives and a **neutral** effect on high-skilled natives.

● Interestingly, immigration from **developed countries**, which have higher proportions of high-skilled immigrants, has a negative employment effect **only** on high-skilled natives, while decreasing the unemployment rate of low-skilled foreigners.

● Finds no evidence of low and medium-skilled natives being negatively affected by immigration in any circumstance.

● Overall, the evidence implies that the policy debate should focus on **redistributive policies** to fully take advantage of the positive effects of immigration.

● Within states, migrants were allocated to counties based on reasons unrelated to local labor market conditions.

● No evidence that neither incomes nor the skill compositions of natives differ substantially between high and low migration counties.

● More importantly, counties that experience small refugee inflows and those with large inflows appear to follow **identical time trends in terms of unemployment, crime and voting patterns.** This allows to obtain credibly causal effects on less stringent identification assumptions. This indicates, also, little evidence of an impact on those from immigration.

● Finds **little evidence** for displacement of native workers by refugees. However,  findings suggest difficulties in integrating refugees into the German labor markets, with increasing difficulties with increasing numbers of them. In other words, finds that former refugees could suffer from newer refugees, suggesting low substitutability between natives and refugees in the labor market. This issue has, however, been suggested untrue by other figures.

● This paper investigates the effects of the flows of immigrant workers on the French labor market between the mid-1970s and mid-1990s.

● Using a system of equations for unemployment, labor-force participation, the real wage, and the immigration rate, it is shown that, **in the long run**, legal and amnestied immigrant workers, and their families, **lower the unemployment rate** **permanently.** This is due to increased consumption and aggregate demand.

● **In the short run**, the arrival of immigrants can **raise aggregate wages** through the complementarity of immigrants and natives and, thus, increase unemployment slightly. However, this effect is **short-lived** and similar to an increase in domestic labour force participation.

● Finds **little evidence** for displacement effects due to migration, concluding that immigrant flows are **not responsible** for France’s high unemployment rates.

● Paper analyses the impact of immigrants on the type and quantity of natives’ jobs using data on fifteen Western European countries during the 1996-2010 period.

● Finds that immigrants, by taking up manual-routine type of occupations, pushed natives towards **more complex** (abstract and communication) **jobs.**

● This job upgrade was associated with a **0.7% increase in native wages** for a **doubling of the immigrants’ share.** 

● These results are robust to the use of an IV strategy based on the past settlement of immigrants across European countries. The job upgrade slowed, but **did not** come to a halt, during the Great Recession of 2008-2009.

● Additionally, the labour market flows behind it show that the complexity of jobs offered to new native hires was greater than that of lost jobs.

● This mechanism **mainly benefits low-skilled immigrants**.

● Analyzes the impact of the immigration influx that took place during the years 2000–2007 in Greece on labor market outcomes. We employ a search and matching framework that allows for skill groups and differential unemployment income (search cost for firms to hire) between immigrants and natives.

● Within such a framework, the study finds that **skilled native workers,** who complement immigrants (who are largely unskilled) in production, **gain in terms of both wages and employment.** The effects on **unskilled native workers**, who compete with immigrants, on the other hand, are **ambiguous** and depend first on the presence of a statutory minimum wage and second on the way that this minimum wage is determined. If there is a minimum wage, **unskilled natives gain in terms of wages, but lose in terms of the unemployment rate.** If there is bargaining with no minimum wage, **they gain in terms of unemployment, but lose when it comes to wages.**

● This article considers how assimilation might shape diversity’s economic benefits in Norway. Intuition suggests two conflicting dynamics. Assimilation could lower barriers immigrants and natives face in interacting with one another, and thus enhance benefits. Equally, however, assimilation could reduce heuristic differences between immigrants and native-born workers, dampening spillovers from diversity.

● Using linked employer–employee data from Norway to test these ideas, the authors construct diversity indices at the regional and workplace scale to capture different aspects of assimilation, and observe how these are related to worker productivity, proxied using wages.

● Finds that assimilation dampens externalities from immigrant diversity. Diversity among second-generation or childhood migrants offers smaller benefits than diversity in teenage or adult arrivals. Immigrants’ cultural proximity to Norway, and their experience of tertiary education in Norway, each also reduce the social return to diversity, while their cultural dissimilarity increases the return.

● While assimilation processes may benefit society in various ways, these findings are consistent with the idea that, by diminishing the heuristic gaps between migrants and native-born workers, integration reduces the productivity externalities derived from immigrant diversity.

● This indicates that, to maintain the largest benefits, a continuous flow of supply of labor is ideal.

● Paper analyzing the impact of an increase in the local supply of immigrants on firms’ outcomes, allowing for heterogeneous effects across firms according to their initial productivity.

● Using micro-level data on French manufacturing firms spanning the period 1995-2005, **a supply-driven increase in the share of foreign-born workers in a French department (a small geographic area) increased the total factor productivity of firms in that department.**

● Immigrants were prevalently highly educated and this effect is consistent with a positive complementarity and spillover effects from their skills.

● **This effect was significantly stronger for firms with low initial productivity and small size. This means that immigration was responsible for the growth of new drivers of the economy.**

● **The positive productivity effect of immigrants was also associated with faster growth of capital, larger exports and higher wages for natives.** Highly skilled natives were **pushed towards firms that did not hire too many immigrants spreading positive productivity effects to those firms too.** Because of stronger effects on smaller and initially less productive firms, the aggregate effects of immigrants at the department level on average productivity and employment was small.

● Paper evaluates the impact of immigration on the labor market outcomes of natives in France over the period 1962-1999.

● Combining large (up to 25%) extracts from six censuses and data from Labor Force Surveys, it exploits the variation in the immigrant share across education/experience cells and over time to identify the impact of immigration.

● Finds that a **10% increase** in immigration **increases native wages by 3%**.

● However, as the number of immigrants and the number of natives are positively and strongly correlated across cells, the immigrant share may not be a good measure of the immigration shock.

● When the log of natives and the log of immigrants are used as regressors instead, the impact of immigration on natives' wages is **still positive but much smaller**, and **natives’ wages are negatively related to the number of natives.**

● To understand this asymmetry and the positive impact of immigration on wages, it explores the link between immigration and the occupational distribution of natives within education/experience cells. Results suggest that immigration leads to the **reallocation of natives to better-paid occupations** within education/experience cells.

● Using data from European Survey on Living Conditions (EU-SILC), estimates the net fiscal position of immigrants in Europe between 2007-2015.

● The net fiscal position is the difference between social services obtained and personal taxes paid leading to be either a fiscal contributor or a fiscal dependent.

● On average, **the fiscal impact of both European and non-European migrants is not different from that of native citizens.**

● Additionally, **EU immigrants in the bottom 5% of the income distribution are not more fiscally dependent than natives in any country**, while **non-EU immigrants in the bottom 5% are substantially larger net contributors than natives in the same bottom 5%.** The same is true for **non-EU immigrants in the top 5% of income, as they contribute considerably more than natives.**

● **Non-EU migrants in Belgium and the Netherlands belonging to the upper tail of the income distribution are much more contributors as compared with the corresponding native citizens of the same income.**

● At last, finds a **very contrasting relationship** between the fiscal perception of European citizens regarding immigrants and the calculated fiscal impact of immigrants: countries, **where immigrants are perceived negatively, are instead countries where migrants are net fiscal contributors and vice-versa**

● A limitation of the study is that it calculates contributions as personal taxes paid by the individual, instead of taxes *caused* by the individual. The migrant also has a job, and generates taxes through their job, and through productivity growth (seen as increase in GDP per capita) and job creation through complementarity. These are contributions which would not be there if the immigrants had not migrated to the country.

● Findings show that immigrants to the UK who arrived since 2000 have made consistently positive fiscal contributions regardless of their area of origin.

● Between 2001 and 2011, recent immigrants contributed **25$ billion** to the fiscal system.

● Between 2001 and 2011 recent immigrants from the A10 countries contributed to the fiscal system about **12% more** than they took out, with a net fiscal contribution of about **£5 billion.**

● At the same time, the net fiscal contributions of recent European immigrants from the rest of the EU totalled **£15bn**, with fiscal payments about **64% higher than transfers received.**

● Immigrants from outside the EU countries made a net fiscal contribution of about **£5.2 billion**, thus paying into the system about **3% more** than they took out.

● In contrast, over the same period, natives made an overall negative fiscal contribution of **£616.5 billion.** The net fiscal balance of overall immigration to the UK between 2001 and 2011 amounts therefore to a positive net contribution of about **£25 billion**, a period over which the UK has run an overall budget deficit.

● Recent immigrants are **43%** (**17 percentage points**) less likely to receive state benefits or tax credits. These differences are partly attributable to immigrants’ more favourable age-gender composition. However, even when compared with natives of the same age, gender composition, and education, recent immigrants are still **39% less likely** than natives to receive benefits.

● Recent immigrants, by sharing the cost of public expenditures insensitive to population size (such as defence) which account for **16%** of total public expenditure, reduced the financial burden of these fixed public obligations for natives by about **£8.5bn** over the period 2001-2011.

● Research points at the strong educational background of immigrants. For instance, while by 2011, the percentage of natives with a degree was **24%**, that of EEA and non-EEA immigrants was **35%** and **41%**, respectively.  Similarly, about one in two native born individuals fall into the “low education” category (defined as those who left full- time education before 17), while only **21%** of EEA immigrants and **23%** of non-EEA immigrants do so.

● Synopsis of the study: [Migrants and refugees are good for economies](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05507-0)

● The present study uses annual statistical data from 15 Western European countries from 1985 to 2015. The selected countries are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Iceland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Portugal, and the UK.

● Attempts to estimate the effects of a migrant shock caused by immigrants and asylum seekers respectively in Europe.

● Finds **no evidence of a deterioration** **of the economic or fiscal situation** **upon the arrival of immigrants or asylum seekers**, because the **increase in public spending is compensated by an increase in tax revenues. On the contrary, finds that over time, asylum seekers have a positive effect on the fiscal balance, lowered unemployment and GDP per capita.**

● The effect of a shock on the net flow of migrants is positive from the year of that shock and remains significant for at least **2 years**. An inflow of asylum seekers takes longer to significantly affect the economy; in particular, significant positive effects on GDP are observed from **3 to 7 years** after this shock.

● The extents of the observed effects also differ: The effects of a shock on the net flow of migrants are strong. GDP per capita increases significantly for **4 years** running, with an increase of **+0.32%** 2 years after the shock; the unemployment rate falls by roughly **0.14 percentage points** 2 years after the shock; and fiscal balance improves by **0.11 percentage points** at its peak, which occurs **1 year** after the shock.

● Attributes the difference in positive effects to the facts that many asylum seekers don’t remain in their host countries for long, and that they find it hard to access the labor market due to lack of legal status. Thus, making it easier for asylum seekers to access the labor market by legalizing asylum seekers and teaching them skills seems apt.

● Can additionally be argued that the reason many asylum seekers don’t remain in their host countries is that they can’t receive legal status, hence a streamlining of the asylum process would increase positive effects.

● Only counts European economic area (EEA) migrants

● High-skilled immigrants increase innovation, increasing productivity per capita and the fiscal balance.

● EEA migrants, especially those from EU13+, pay more in taxes than they receive in welfare benefits and consume in public services. Net fiscal benefit is strongly related to earnings and to age.

● EEA migrants make a larger contribution both in terms of money and work to the NHS than they receive in health services. No evidence that migration has reduced the quality of healthcare.

● EEA migrants are a small but increasing share of the social care workforce. Very few EEA migrants receive social care. Growing demand for social care but wages and conditions make it hard to recruit and retain UK residents. May also struggle to recruit migrants with other options. Sector needs a coherent approach to financing.

● Migrants or the children of migrants make up an increasing proportion of the school-age population. EEA migrants are a smaller proportion of workers than students in primary and secondary education but a higher proportion in higher education. Children with English as an additional language academically out-perform children with English as a first language. **These two benefits count for low-skilled immigrants too, as their children are much more productive than native citizens.** No evidence that migration has reduced the educational attainment of other children or the choice of schools.

● EEA migrants, especially those from EU13+, pay more in taxes than they receive in welfare benefits and consume in public services. Net fiscal benefit is strongly related to earnings and to age.

● Study showing a specific area in which immigrants use less on social spending than natives

● Routine anonymized data were used to identify people who appear as registering with a general practitioner (GP) for the first time in England yet are aged 15 or over. We assumed that most long-term residents will have registered before the age of 15, and therefore the majority of those registering for the first time later in life will be international immigrants. The study compared hospital admissions among first registrants to the general population of England and to within-England migrants, selected using propensity scoring.

● The first registrants aged 15 or over had around half the rate of hospital admission as that of the general population of England. They were also less likely to have a hospital admission than a matched group of within-England migrants. The lower admission rates persisted over several years and were consistent in three consecutive cohorts of first registrants (each consisting of over half a million people).

● Without international migration:  

○ The 2060 EU production or output (real GDP) would be **23% lower** (Italy **-33%**, Spain **-28%**, UK **-19%**, Germany **-35%**, France **-18%**), compared to the projection with migration.  

○ In 2060 there could be an estimated output loss of almost **7 trillion US$**, compared to the scenario with migration (Figure B).  

○ The cumulative output loss for the entire projection period would be around **47 trillion US$** (discounted at a 3% rate).  

○ That would mean losing almost twenty years of economic growth: the 2043 EU output which could be reached with migration would be only attained without migration in 2060.  

○ The annual EU growth rate would fall over the long term (for the 2013-2060 period) from **1.5%** to less than **1.0%**.  

○ In 2060 the EU output per capita with migration flows would be around **57,000 US$**, but it would fall to around **51,000 US$** without migration (around **10%**). Most of the EU population would be worse off.

● Study on what would be the best policies for integrating migrants into the EU commissioned by the European Commission's Joint Research Center:

● Limited to socioeconomic effects

● Simulates integration measures like providing welfare benefits, language and professional training to varying degrees;

● Concludes that the initial investment is repaid after **9 years** (at full integration policy) to 19 years (at non-integration), and that depending on the integration policy and financing method, long-run GDP growth would be **0.2-1.4%** above the baseline

● Integrated refugees address Europe’s alarming demographic trends, fill vacancies with specific skill requirements, improve the ratio of economically active to those who are inactive, a ratio that is falling in many Member States, and boost jobs and growth in the EU.

● According to simulation results for the policy “status quo integration scenario”, the long-run cost of **non-integration** is likely to be considerably higher than the short-run investment costs of the refugee integration, as shown in the full integration scenario.

● Study examines the long-term per capita growth effects of refugee immigration with the help of an augmented Cobb–Douglas production model and a two-step quantitative analysis that explored a range of economic scenarios.

● Indicates that refugee immigration can lead to long-term per capita growth. Key to this development is the age structure of refugees and, to a slightly lesser degree, their qualification structure.

● The length of time needed by refugees to integrate mainly determines the time required to reach the break-even point. This means that making it easier and faster to seek asylum status improves the positive effects.

● Interestingly, the results show that capital stock has the greatest impact on per capita growth. Without a migration-related increase in the available capital stock in the host country, positive per capita growth is unlikely, even under optimistic assumptions. In fact, the per capita economic output could drop significantly. Usually, an increase in the supply of labor (like with migration) encourages companies to invest in a country to take advantage of that supply, [as the labor to capital ratio tends to stay the same over the long term with immigration.](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1542-4774.2011.01052.x?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&userIsAuthenticated=false)

● Only counts European Economic Area (EEA) migrant effects

● Evidence that immigration has, on average, a positive impact on productivity. Some evidence that this impact is larger for high-skilled migrants than lower-skilled migrants.

● No evidence that migration has reduced the training opportunities of the UK-born, meaning the quality of their education and therefore their wages don’t suffer as a result.

● Evidence that migration, especially lower-skilled, has reduced the prices of personal services. Evidence that migration has raised house prices, more in areas where house building is more restricted. The solution is then to make house building easier.

**FOSSIL FUELS**
# **Land and Air Damage**
**Fossil fuels cause an extraordinary amount of land and air damage**

● [EESI - Coleman and Dietz 19](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.eesi.org/papers/view/fact-sheet-fossil-fuel-subsidies-a-closer-look-at-tax-breaks-and-societal-costs%23targetText=According%20to%20the%20IMF,%20%22fossil,by%203.8%20percent%20of%20GDP.%22)

○ AIR AND LAND DESTRUCTION FROM FOSSIL FUELS

○ Burning fossil fuels creates **air pollutants** such as:

■ particulate matter

■ carbon monoxide

■ sulfur dioxide

■ ozone

■ Mercury

● (note: Coal-fired power plants are also the largest source of airborne mercury emissions in the United States. Mercury can move through the food chain and accumulate in the flesh of fish, posing the greatest risk to pregnant women)

○ These pollutants lead to **health impacts** including:

■ Asthma

■ lung disease

■ Bronchitis

■ and other chronic respiratory diseases that may lead to premature death

○ Air pollutants from fossil fuels also contribute to:

■ the development of **lung cancers** as well as other cancers (30 percent of cancer-related deaths each year)

■ 200,000 p**remature deaths** each year.

○ Fine particulate matter from U.S. coal plants (in 2010) resulted in:

■ 13,200 deaths

■ 9,700 hospitalizations

■ 20,000 **heart attacks**
Extraction and refining of fossil fuel may result in a host of negative outcomes including:

■ landscape degradation

■ risk for spills

○ Coal extraction and burning involves

■ **Strip mining** (65% of production

● (note: Involves clearing vegetation, soil, and rock above coal deposits, leading to permanent damage of landscapes and the creation of massive amounts of mine wastes)

■ pollution across the supply chain

■ **coal ash deposits**

● a combustion byproduct containing toxic heavy metals like arsenic, mercury, and chromium

● one of the largest sources of industrial waste in the United States

● 95 percent of coal ash storage sites have **contaminated groundwater** at levels deemed unsafe by the EPA

● In the flooding that followed Hurricane Florence, several coal ash storage sites in North Carolina overflowed or were damaged, spilling contaminated water into surrounding area

○ Some major **oil spills**:

■ The 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill polluted 1,300 miles of shore and cost about $2 billion to clean up

■ The 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the largest ever, released 3.19 million barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico and cost BP (the company responsible) $61.6 billion.

■ The 2010 Enbridge spill in southwest Michigan released more than 20,100 barrels of tar sands oil into the Kalamazoo River, creating one of the largest inland oil spills in U.S. history.

■ The Taylor oil spill is on track to become the largest in American history, having released tens of thousands of gallons every day into the Gulf of Mexico for more than 14 years.

○ The US government spends approximately **$20.5 billion** subsidizing the fossil fuel industry [1]

■ $14.7 billion federal subsidies

■ $5.8 billion state subsidies

○ Subsidies:

■ **prop up** the existing fossil fuel sector

■ drive up fossil fuel **extraction and use**

■ develop **domestic fossil fuel assets**

■ represent an **obstacle to renewable energy** investment by artificially increasing the relative cost of renewable energy [2]

○ If we got rid of fossil fuel subsidies, **almost half of all new US oil production would be unprofitable and thus left undeveloped** [3]

○ Analysis of a number of studies from around the world on the feasibility of 100% renewables.

○ In brief, the study includes explanations that:

■ There’s more than enough solar, wind and hydro potential – **30 times more** than business-as-usual forecasts for energy demand in 2050.

■ Technology already exists to **account for the variability** of wind and solar generation, so that the lights will stay on even when the weather doesn’t cooperate.

■ We do not need to alter the design of the electric grid radically to accommodate 100 percent renewables: The shift is well underway and accelerating.

■ **Costs won’t be overwhelming**. A grid based on 100 percent renewables can compete in cost with fossil fuel systems, even before factoring in the tremendous costs of pollution, global warming and water usage.

■ A number of nations and regions are at or close to 100 percent renewables already, including Denmark, Norway and parts of Germany. Canada is at 62 percent renewables and Brazil at 76 percent.

# **Impact of Climate Change**
**Climate change causes floods, exacerbates natural disasters, and puts homes underwater**
## Sea Level and Flooding
● [National Ocean Service](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/sealevelclimate.html)

○ Why Climate change effects sea levels

■ oceans warm due to an increasing global temperature, causing seawater to expand and take up more space in the ocean basin and causing a rise in water level.

■ melting of ice over land, which adds water to the ocean.

● [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: Lindsey 18](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-sea-level)

○ *“The rising water level is mostly due to a combination of **meltwater from glaciers and ice sheets** and **thermal expansion** of seawater as it warms.”*

○ Scope: In the United States, almost **40 percent of the population** lives in relatively high population-density **coastal areas**, where sea level plays a role in flooding, shoreline erosion, and hazards from storms.

■ Globally, **8 of the world’s 10 largest cities** are **near a coast,** according to the U.N. Atlas of the Oceans.

○ Sea levels have been **continuously rising** and put these areas under threat:

● [Climate Central Executive Report: Strauss  et al. 12](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/slr.s3.amazonaws.com/SurgingSeas.pdf)

○ Climate change sea level impact

■ raised sea level about **eight inches** since 1880

■  the rate of rise is accelerating

■ Scientists expect **20 to 80 more inches** this century, a lot depending upon how much more heat-trapping pollution humanity puts into the sky

■ This study makes mid-range projections of **1 to 8 inches** by 2030, and **4 to 19 inches** by 2050, depending upon location across the contiguous 48 states.

○ Climate change flooding impact

■ Rising seas **dramatically increase the odds of damaging floods** from storm surges.

■ For more than two-thirds of the locations analyzed (and for 85% of sites outside the Gulf of Mexico), past and future global warming more than **doubles t**he estimated odds of “century” or worse floods occurring within the next **18 years**

○ Impact on homes

■ At three quarters of the 55 sites analyzed, century levels are higher than 4 feet above the high tide line.

■ Across the country nearly 5 million people live in 2.6 million homes at less than 4 feet above high tide.

■ In 285 cities and towns, more than half the population lives on land below this line, potential victims of increasingly likely climate-induced coastal flooding.

■ 3.7 million live less than 1 meter above the tide.

■ About half of this exposed population, and eight of the top 10 cities, are in the state of Florida. About $30 billion in taxable property is vulnerable below the three-foot line in just three counties in southeast Florida.

They are the most carbon-dense ecosystems on Earth; a typical northern peatland packs in roughly ten times as much carbon as a boreal forest. When peat burns, it releases its ancient carbon to the atmosphere, adding to the heat-trapping gases that cause climate change.'*

○ Uses two scenarios, A2 and B1

○ According to [Wikipedia](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Report_on_Emissions_Scenarios), here is what this means:

■ The A2 scenarios are of a more divided world. The A2 family of scenarios is characterized by:

● A world of independently operating, self-reliant nations.

● Continuously increasing population.

● Regionally oriented economic development.

● Low emissions

● The B1 scenarios are of a world more integrated, and more ecologically friendly. The B1 scenarios are characterized by:

■ Rapid economic growth as in A1, but with rapid changes towards a service and information economy.

■ Population rising to 9 billion in 2050 and then declining as in A1.

■ Reductions in material intensity and the introduction of clean and resource efficient technologies.

■ An emphasis on global solutions to economic, social and environmental stability.

○ *‘Under the high-end A2 scenario, **12–39% and 10–48% of the Earth's terrestrial surface may respectively experience novel and disappearing climates by 2100 AD**. Corresponding projections for the low-end B1 scenario are 4–20% and 4–20%.’*

○ Finds that “**almost two-thirds of the impacts related to atmospheric and ocean temperature can be confidently attributed to anthropogenic forcing**” and that “**anthropogenic climate change has been a major influence for approximately three-quarters of the impacts observed on continental scales**”

○ This is based on the methodology of finding “human fingerprints” in atmospheric CO2 measurements through the density of the atoms in the carbon (813C) which can distinguish between naturally derived and anthropogenically (human) derived sources of CO2 emissions. The more negative the 813C, the higher the proportion of carbon that comes from fossil fuel emissions. In this, it is possible to know that the emission of fossil fuels is the greatest cause of CO2 emissions since before the Industrial Revolution.

○ The key criticisms are:

■ **Methodological concerns** - The study uses a method that is to do with overall change in height, which has been seen as flawed. From the Scientific American article: *‘To translate the change in height (and therefore volume) into a change in mass, scientists must assume a certain density. The question is: Just what is rising? Is it snow or ice? Zwally contends it is ice, and argues that at the end of the last ice age, roughly 10,000 years ago, the amount of snowfall doubled. This would mean that it has been compacting into solid ice for millennia and continues to do so today. Most other scientists, however, do not agree that this is still going on now and argue that any increase in the ice sheet's height is from added snowfall alone. In this case, the density of snow would be the right number to use.’*

■ **Statistical outlier** - This seems to be contrary to what most studies show. I suggest having a look at [this study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/05/170505103649.htm), [this study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0179-y.epdf?referrer_access_token=TYg8T92FGOT9G_Kv9_DNgdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PBEKqWHTwARrIrR4OxoHFd5WZGh-A0FX8FPbkdWIZLYbZCBmLyubdQ_PJ-ByV-lktc4sK-i0k4Fgwsy_yMprqf5KWlFcgGCz2GzGBbXyq0GXqIvzrgTSjPRHnUT1UoVgohEiG-Em3yFoz8Jd5md4VvOBRKAEFrtj-7F4sUCZ4LKkPoFCf8OVmkBhovnvHoBuvszHF4aOVnkfdsaISS_Qm6mT1mnt1Gj4NKjnB3K7qeCQ%3D%3D&tracking_referrer=www.pbs.org) and [this study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014GL060111), plus a whole host more if you look through the articles I linked up above.

■ **Read the study** - It actually shows the amount of ice being gained is slowing down over the years, which should prove that even if this data is correct, it still shows evidence of climate change’s impact. From the NASA article: *‘According to the new analysis of satellite data, the Antarctic ice sheet showed a net gain of 112 billion tons of ice a year from 1992 to 2001. That net gain slowed  to 82 billion tons of ice per year between 2003 and 2008.’*

■ **Without context** - Even if the findings are true, the amount of ice lost in Greenland far outweighs any gain in Antarctica. According to [this study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1855-2), the amount of annual ice lost in Greenland went from 25 billion to 234 billion tons from 1992 to 2018, showing an upward trend in the amount of ice lost, while in the NASA study, they show a downward trend of the amount of ice gained in Antarctica. In fact, the head author himself also says climate change is a problem that must be dealt with. From the Scientific American article: *‘Zwally notes that he was vigilant about this in 2015. “When our paper came out, I was very careful to emphasize that this is in no way contradictory to the findings of the IPCC report or conclusions that climate change is a serious problem that we need to do something about,” he says.’*

○ According to [Snopes](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/nations-vanish-global-warming/), his statement was nations would be under water **at some time in the more distant future**, not the way it is usually interpreted, which is ‘this guy believes nations would be underwater in 10 years,’ and the scenarios were looking all the way into 2100. What he was saying was that we had 10 years to reverse the effects of climate change before the effects become out of human control.

○ By whole nations, Brown probably meant nations in the Pacific like Kiribati, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and more, which all, among others, [may potentially be underwater in the next 50 years](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.businessinsider.com/these-island-nations-could-be-underwater-in-as-little-as-fifty-years-2015-12?r=US&IR=T) according to a UN report

○ In fact, people that work in medicine (3,046) are almost as high a number as people who work in some sort of climate science!

○ That means I could be a doctor or a programmer (medical and computing science degrees are included, two very unrelated fields to climate science) and without professionally knowing anything about climate change, I can sign this petition

○ And again, these people do not represent the consensus (go to Climate and Pollution > Anthropogenic Consensus)

○ When [Scientific American](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://web.archive.org/web/20060823125025/http://www.sciam.com/page.cfm?section=sidebar&articleID=0004F43C-DC1A-1C6E-84A9809EC588EF21) tried to reach out to 30 random signatories, this is what happened: *‘Of the 26 we were able to identify in various databases, 11 said they still agreed with the petition—one was an active climate researcher, two others had relevant expertise, and eight signed based on an informal evaluation. Six said they would not sign the petition today, three did not remember any such petition, one had died, and five did not answer repeated messages.’*

● **But what about [Climategate](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatic_Research_Unit_email_controversy)?**

○ Climategate was the leak of emails and computer files from climate researchers at the University of East Anglia in the UK, and many claimed it proved that climate change was a hoax, as the department at the university is one of the country’s leaders in climate research.

○ People claim the contents of these emails showed that the scientists had manipulated data. However, [FactCheck.org](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.factcheck.org/2009/12/climategate/)’s analysis found that climate deniers misrepresented contents of the emails

○ The [House of Commons' Science and Technology Committee](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmsctech/387/387i.pdf) and [an independent report](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/08/science/earth/08climate.html) both **found no systematic evidence** of manipulated data from the university.

● **There was a survey of meteorologists that showed [only 52%](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/614966433281212433/758800055817470042/2016-01-15-05-21-43.png) believe in man made climate change!**

○ For context, this was a [study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/BAMS-D-13-00091.1) that surveyed members of the American Meteorological Society.

○ First of all, almost half have never published in climate science (out of 1821 people, 800 are classified as non publishing).

○ And those who actually specialise or research in climate science are much more likely to believe in man made climate change. 73% who publish most of their work in climate science agree with man made climate change (**rises to 78% with just climate scientists**), compared to 62% who mostly publish in other fields (rises to 71% with just climate scientists), and 37% who have not published in climate science (about the same level with just climate scientists).

○ And for those who said there was insufficient evidence (20% of the total sample), they **still lean much more towards man made than not man made**, 11% of the total sample.

○ This hypothesis that people who have much more experience with climate science is quite consistent with other studies. People who know more about expert consensus are [much more likely](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1295) to believe in climate change and support activism against it. And [another survey](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2009eo030002&hl=en&sa=T&oi=ucasa&ct=ufr&ei=d-dtX6ndIcTCmAH9kLPQBg&scisig=AAGBfm3EYdUYe82tqX95ECJmmYLwheHkxg)  of scientists found this response to the question 'Do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures?':

○ Though it is true that even 73% is a bit low (but way higher than 52%), it is a statistical outlier and a cherry picked study compared to the mountain of evidence showing much higher consensus (go to Climate and Pollution > Anthropogenic Consensus)

○ **The American Meteorological Society [accepts the consensus](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ametsoc.org/ams/index.cfm/about-ams/ams-and-climate-change/).**

○ The authors of the study have [criticised interpretations of the study to promote climate denialism](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/www.climatesciencewatch.org/2013/11/28/taylor-distorts-poll-of-meteorologists-on-climate-change/).

● **Hang on, the Earth’s temperature has gone up and down [many times](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/614966433281212433/759068544460652554/epica_temperature.png) in history, surely it’s all just natural!**

○ What happened in the past is called [Milankovitch Cycles](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles) ([NASA article that explains it better](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2948/milankovitch-orbital-cycles-and-their-role-in-earths-climate/)), where some variations happen in the Earth’s tilt and position relative to the sun.

○ Three main things happen during this time:

○ Obliquity is the most significant factor in this. Its tilt creates a slight heating of the planet, which in turn releases CO2 from the ocean, which then increases temperature even more, and creates a positive feedback loop. This is evident in the fact that [CO2 historically lags behind (but is very closely correlated to) temperature](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.skepticalscience.com/co2-lags-temperature-intermediate.htm).

○ But the climate crisis today cannot be explained by that. For starters, interglacial periods (which is when it reaches the spikes in hottest temperature) caused by Milankovitch Cycles took thousands of years to go from the glacial period (when it is at a stable temperature) to the peak of an interglacial period  What we are seeing right now is happening in about 200 years. One [study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/08/130801142420.htm) found that climate change is occurring ten times faster than at any time in the past 65 million years.

○ The obliquity is actually moving inwards.The Earth’s obliquity hit 24.5° in 8,700 BCE, which means the tilt is going in towards the North Pole. We are currently at 23.44°.

● **Did [Benny Peiser](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/ep38eletter.pdf) not debunk Oreskes 2004, which claimed absolutely no contradicting papers to the scientific consensus?**

○ Peiser himself went on to say that his [debunk was flawed](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/ep38peiser.pdf):

○ *‘Some of the abstracts that I included in the 34 "reject or doubt" category are very ambiguous and should not have been included.’* 

○ In fact, most studies that Peiser claimed rejected the consensus did not actually reject it.

○ *‘Only [a] few abstracts explicitly reject or doubt the AGW (anthropogenic global warming) consensus which is why I have publicly withdrawn this point of my critique.’*

○ And those that did reject the consensus were editorials or letters, not peer reviewed studies

○ His study basically strengthened consensus, by not being able to properly find a study that disputed the consensus.

**VACCINES**

Vaccines are safe, effective, and do not cause autism.

In light of all of the debate about COVID vaccines, it’s important to note that **this section doesn’t talk about the COVID vaccine**. We’ll get to that eventually but we’re lazy and there’s a LOT of ground to cover regarding that specific topic.
# **Vaccines are Good**

○ There was evidence of an association between MMR vaccine and a small risk of idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpura (ITP). However, the risk is TWICE as high if infected with MMR.

○ Reporters followed 13 million children who received the vaccine--found **NO association between MMR vaccine and autism**

■ Three case-patients had unknown vaccination status

○ Other contributing factors included exposure to infants too young for the MMR vaccine

○ Two-thirds of the cases in this outbreak were hospitalized for respiratory complications.

○ Anti Vaccine misinformation was spread heavily in Minnesota by anti vaccine groups like the Vaccine Safety Council of Minnesota among Somali parents which **led to this spike in vaccine refusal and ultimately resulted in outbreaks**.

# **Vaccines Do Not Cause Autism Or SIDS**
**This misinformation has been spread largely by “Anti-Vaxxers” and discredited papers. These claims too often rely on confusing correlation with causation, or have other issues with them.**
## Autism:
● A list of institutions that have reviewed evidence from all the studies and have all concluded that vaccines DO NOT cause autism or ASD.

○ Institute of Medicine

○ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

○ The Vaccine Injury Compensation Program

○ The American Academy of Pediatrics.

● This vaccine-autism claim can be traced back to a study by [Andrew Wakefield](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield), but **his study had a lot of issues**

○ Published a study in 1998 with 11 co-authors claiming to find a correlation between the MMR vaccine and autism

○ The **study did not stand the test of time** and the **results could not be replicated**

○ 10 of the 12 authors have since retracted their support and the Journal Lancet retracted the paper in 2004.

○ Andrew Wakefield has been the subject of ethics investigation by the General Medical Council for conflicts of interest in the 1998 paper

■ Wakefield was being paid as an expert by trial lawyers interested in suing Vaccine Manufacturers over alleged injuries. Some of the children used in the study were children of the parents who were suing.

■ The General Medical Council in the UK stripped Wakefield of his medical license for research misconduct.

● **The 2014 documentary VAXXED also attempted to support Wakefield’s claims** that the MMR vaccine was linked to autism

○  VAXXED covers William Thompson who became known as a “CDC whistleblower” for alleging scientific misconduct at the CDC.

○ Thompson co-authored a CDC study in 2004 that failed to find a link between MMR vaccine and autism.

○ Thompson’s CDC allegations were used, by anti-vaccine activist Brian Hooker, to support the claim that the CDC “covered up” data that showed evidence of an increased risk of autism among African American boys who received their first MMR Vaccine before 36 months.

○ **There is NO evidence that the CDC committed fraud.**

■ The only thing Thompson mentions is a scientific disagreement over what data to publish in the CDC’s 2004 paper.

○ **The CDC did not hide any data from the public.**

■ The data set used by the CDC in the 2004 paper has always been available to qualified researchers.

○ **The CDC did NOT cover up a finding that MMR Vaccine is linked to autism.**

■ The CDC released a population-based study in Atlanta in 2004.

■ The study looked at children with autism and children who did not have autism, then looked at the age of the MMR vaccine was given to see if children who had autism were more likely to have been vaccinated at a certain age than those who did not.

■ No association was found but it did find that children who had autism were more likely to have been vaccinated later than 24 months but before 36 months than those who did not.

■ Further information was gathered from all study subjects who had Georgia birth certificates to see if there were any factors that could explain this finding (birth-weight, parents’ age, mother’s education level etc.).

■ After controlling for those factors, the anomaly [disappeared](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.harpocratesspeaks.com/2014/09/mmr-cdc-and-brian-hooker-media-guide.html) meaning there was no link found between MMR vaccine and autism.

■ The researchers argued that any higher likelihood of children with Autism having received the MMR vaccine was likely due to immunization requirements for special education preschool.

○ **The CDC did not use birth certificates to intentionally exclude African Americans.**

■ Anti-vaccine activists claimed that the CDC only required birth certificates for African Americans in the study so they could be excluded from the birth certificate subgroup analysis.

■ This was supposed to show that the CDC wanted to cover up a link between MMR vaccine and autism in African American boys.

■ However, the researchers used birth certificates for all the children in the study. Image below is from the [study](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14754936/).

● [Hooker 14](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4128611/)

○ A re-analysis of the 2004 CDC study by Brian Hooker concluded that African American boys who received the MMR vaccine between 24 and 36 months were at a 3-fold increased risk for autism. Found no association for any other group.

○ **BAD MODELS, BAD STUDY** - used statistical models that didn’t account for factors other than the MMR vaccine that could skew the results.

■ Finding a three-fold increased risk at 36 months is not surprising because autism is usually diagnosed by the time a child is 36 months. The 2004 CDC study used models to account for age. This study did NOT.

■ Used the same CDC dataset but used a different study design.  This is likely to introduce errors into the analysis.

○ **LIMITED DATASET** - After excluding low-birth weight infants, the timeline had to be modified from a 36 month cut-off to 31 months because there were LESS THAN 5 people in this group.

■ This was likely a very SMALL subgroup and the number of children used in the analysis is UNKNOWN.

○ The study has since been retracted due to undeclared conflicts of interest and invalid statistics and methods.

● [Jain et al. 15](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2275444)

○ Retrospective cohort study involving 95,727 children with older siblings with and without autism

○  “In this large sample of privately insured children with older siblings, **receipt of the MMR vaccine was not associated with increased risk of ASD**, regardless of whether older siblings had ASD. These findings indicate no harmful association between MMR vaccine receipt and ASD even among children already at higher risk for ASD.”

○ A case-control study investigating the relationship between the risk of autism and early exposure to the combined MMR vaccine and thimerosal consumption

○ There were **NO significant differences in MMR vaccination and thimerosal dosage between cases and controls AT ANY AGE**.

○ “**NO convincing evidence was found in this study that MMR vaccination and increasing thimerosal dose were associated with and increased risk of ASD onset**.”

○ Meta-analysis assessing the relationship between vaccine administration and the subsequent development of Autism or ASD.

○ Included in the analysis were five cohort **studies involving over 1 MILLION children** and five case-control studies involving 9,920 children.

○ “Findings of this meta-analysis suggest that **vaccinations are not associated with the development of autism or autism spectrum disorder**. Furthermore, the components of the vaccines (thimerosal or mercury) or **multiple vaccines (MMR) are not associated with the development of autism or autism spectrum disorder**.”

**OTHER CLAIMS:**

● **CLAIM: In 1986, Autism rates were 1 in 15,000 children. After the National Childhood Vaccination Injury Act of 1986, Autism rate was 1 in 10,000. Today, it is about 1 in 50**.

○ [https://youtu.be/8Tl3tUQng9Q](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://youtu.be/8Tl3tUQng9Q)

○ This is PURE CORRELATION. No cause is implied here. The much more likely reason for the Autism rates is an increase in diagnoses.

○ Just because two things are happening at the same time does NOT prove a link between them, let alone a cause.

● **CLAIM: Somali Americans have higher rates of autism in Minnesota than other ethnic groups so they are right to be suspicious of MMR Vaccine.** 

○ [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-016-2793-6](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-016-2793-6)

○ Found that Somali children were just AS LIKELY to be diagnosed with autism as white children

○ However, the study did find that Somali children with autism were more likely to have an intellectual disability than other ethnic groups.

■ This, however, does NOT prove that vaccination was the cause. There have been other proposed potential causes such as Vitamin D deficiency.
## SIDS:

○ **Meta-analysis** examining the relationship between immunization and SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome).

○ Examined nine case-control studies that **found either no association or found an association with a REDUCED risk of SIDS**.

○ “**Immunisations are associated with a halving of the risk of SIDS**. There are biological reasons why this association may be causal, but other factors, such as the healthy vaccine effect, may be important. Immunisations should be part of the SIDS prevention campaigns.”

# **Debunking Misc Anti-Vax Claims**
● **CLAIM: The components in vaccines, thimerosal (mercury) and aluminum, are not safe and lead to neurotoxicity in children.**

○ [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/patient-ed/conversations/downloads/vacsafe-thimerosal-color-office.pdf](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/patient-ed/conversations/downloads/vacsafe-thimerosal-color-office.pdf)

○ Thimerosal is a compound that contains mercury that is used as a preservative in certain vaccines to prevent the growth of bacteria. In 1999, the U.S public health service recommended the removal of thimerosal in childhood vaccines to reduce infant exposure to mercury. This was a PRECAUTIONARY measure. Thimerosal was never proven to be dangerous.

○ Thimerosal contains ethylmercury which is different from methylmercury. Methylmercury is what is found in bodies of water, fish, or other food. High amounts of methylmercury is dangerous to the nervous system.

○ Ethylmercury is broken down differently and quickly by the blood and exists in such low levels in vaccines as to be [completely safe.](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/index.html%23:~:text=Thimerosal%20has%20been%20shown%20to,doses%20of%20thimerosal%20in%20vaccines.) 

○ Other than the flu vaccine, Thimerosal has been removed from childhood vaccines since 2001. (Flu vaccine has a thimerosal-free dose for children)

○ [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/adjuvants.html](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/adjuvants.html)

○ Aluminum is an adjuvant which helps vaccines work better by creating a stronger immune response in people

○ Aluminum-containing adjuvants has been [safely](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22001122/) used in vaccines since the 1930s

○ Aluminum is one of the most common metals found in nature. Infants are exposed to more aluminum in breast milk or formula than from vaccines.

● **CLAIM: I have never been vaccinated and neither has my child and we never got sick with any of these diseases.**

○ While this may be true, this is most likely because the majority of the rest of us are immunized through vaccines. In other words, the child is benefitting from [Herd Immunity.](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/herd-immunity) This means that enough people are vaccinated around you that it makes infectious disease difficult to spread. Herd immunity is also incredibly important for children who can’t get vaccinated (those with weak immune systems).

○ [https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6740a3.htm?s_cid=mm6740a3_w](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6740a3.htm?s_cid=mm6740a3_w) 

■ The percentage of kindergarten age children that are vaccinated remains HIGH.

○ Using this as an argument against vaccines is a textbook example of the [composition fallacy](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_composition). This occurs when someone infers that something is true of the whole because it is true among some parts of the whole.

■ If everyone didn’t vaccinate their children because a few parents’ children never got sick, herd immunity would break down and the result would be outbreaks and epidemics of infectious diseases.  

● **CLAIM: MMR vaccine has killed children. Disease can be deadly but so are vaccines.**

○ [https://www.idsociety.org/public-health/measles/myths-and-facts/](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.idsociety.org/public-health/measles/myths-and-facts/)

○ There have been NO recorded deaths from the MMR vaccine.

○ There have been some rare cases of death from side effects of the vaccine among children with compromised immune systems. These children are also NOT recommended to get the vaccination.

○ The vaccine prevents THOUSANDS of death each year.  

● **CLAIM: The flu vaccine isn’t even effective!**

○ While it is true that influenza is a difficult virus to create a near perfect vaccine for because the strains quickly mutate, this does not mean that the flu vaccine is ineffective.

○ Still, even though the effectiveness varies year by year, it still provides protection and is safe to receive.

● **CLAIM: Vaccine manufacturers are not regulated like other drugs. They can put whatever they want inside of them.**

○ [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/infographics/journey-of-child-vaccine-h.pdf](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/infographics/journey-of-child-vaccine-h.pdf)

○ Vaccines are held to a HIGHER standard than other pharmaceutical drugs because they are given to healthy individuals.

○ Vaccines typically undergo YEARS of clinical trials

○ The benefit-risk ratio must be shown to be exceptional.

○ After approval, vaccines are continually monitored for safety.

● **CLAIM: Parents have the right to not vaccinate their child if they so choose.**

○ This is a philosophical issue that comes down to different values. I would argue parents DON’T have this right. First, this “right” would lead to endangering the lives of others and their children. In other words, public health outweighs your personal beliefs about vaccines and parental authority.

● **CLAIM: Vaccines make the immune system weaker. It is better to let your body fight off diseases naturally.**

○ [https://youtu.be/MSsVTaLkPng](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://youtu.be/MSsVTaLkPng) 

○ While it can be true that natural infection causes better immunity than vaccines, the price paid for fighting off disease naturally can be deadly. For example, developing liver cancer from hepatitis B or death from measles.

○ The goal is to produce immunity. It doesn’t matter where the bacteria comes from. With vaccines, immunity is achieved without the risks associated with the virus itself.

■ [https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/the-pertussis-resurgence/](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/the-pertussis-resurgence/)

■ Recent outbreaks of pertussis show that immunity from natural infection weakens over time too (4-20 years).

● **CLAIM: The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program has paid out billions of dollars to Americans who have been damaged by vaccines.**

○ [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/health/you-should-get-vaccinated.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/health/you-should-get-vaccinated.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article)

○ Out of the 21,000 people who have filed claims, about 6,600 people have been compensated over a 30 year period.

○ About 70% were settlements in cases where no sufficient evidence was found that the vaccine caused any injury

○ The CDC estimates vaccines have prevented 732,000 deaths among children in just a 20-year period.

■ Even if we accept the number of people who have been compensated as those who have legitimately suffered injury from a vaccine, the lives saved greatly outweighs this risk.

● Chile was plunged into a financial crisis in 1982, following its premature and ill-designed financial liberalization in the late 1970s. Faced with the crisis, the Pinochet government which had come to power in the name of defending free markets, rescued the entire banking sector with public money

● In Greece, the SOE sector is filled with former inefficient private firms, which were nationalized, thus bailed out, because of their political importance. It is no surprise that the Greek SOE sector has performed poorly

● **CLAIM: Only capitalism can make major innovations, thanks to free market competition.**

○ It’s good to have mentioned competition, as that's the main driver of innovation here, not capitalism. The world wars and cold war brought about a lot of new innovation, not just in the military but also in various other fields - many of those innovations could be applied in other fields, e.g. nuclear bomb tech being refitted for power plants.

○ Some innovations require lots of resources and few restrictions (e.g. making a profit), which is something which small businesses and many large firms aren't incentived to do. For example, the development of nuclear tech, rocket technology, and the US interstate highway system all revolutionized aspects of american life but would not have been possible with a profit motive restricting incentives and the lack of resources which is accessible only truly by a large state apparatus, like the US government.

○ Capitalism can easily discourage innovation by forcing firms to stick to safe trends rather than innovate which tends to be a much higher financial risk

● **CLAIM: Capitalism is the only system that forces you to care about the needs of others.**

○ How is this not true for other systems? Under feudalism, you were forced to care about those above you in the hierarchy, and to fulfill their needs. In the case of government, you usually need to satisfy the needs of your constituents at least to some extent if you don't want to be overthrown. In ancient hunter-gatherer tribes, if you didn't contribute to the group as a whole you were considered a lot less useful and more likely to be dumped. Why can't altruism not be considered a key component of all functional societies rather than just of capitalist societies specifically?

The best counter to this sort of thing would be a "selfish altruism" sort of argument but that sort of stuff is next to unfalsifiable and often rests more on assumption than proof, plus that doesn’t actually do anything to demonstrate that humans aren’t altruistic.

○ It’s not a real university, but rather a conservative think tank which [benefitted early on from funding by wealthy conservative donors](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=PragerU%23Funding). This is not a non-partisan group by any means.

○ They’ve taken up unscientific stances on a variety of issues, ranging from [climate change](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://features.weather.com/course-climate-misinformation/) to [trans issues](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://transhealthproject.org/resources/medical-organization-statements/) to [evolution](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcZOzHMOXoQ).

○ Plenty of PragerU videos bring on people who have no expertise in the field they're talking about. Here's a few examples:

■ [“Comedian” Steven Crowder](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.prageru.com/presenter/steven-crowder/), who talks about democratic socialism

■ [NFL player Burgess Owens](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.prageru.com/presenter/burgess-owens/), who talks about slave reparations

■ [Dinesh D'Souza](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.prageru.com/presenter/dinesh-dsouza/), who has been a very controversial political figure who has no degrees in political science or related fields yet is brought onto PragerU to speak about complex political issues

# **13/50 and related FBI-UCR stats**
**“Despite making up 13% of the population, blacks commit 50% of the violent crime.” This claim is addressed thoroughly here without diving too much into socio-economic factors. A lot of the points made here can also be applied to other UCR stats, as we also address the general reliability of the UCR program. [Here is a google doc version of this section**](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://docs.google.com/document/u/2/d/1L_qk_3lC20swQVEGDQPRJko-0FSH-egnNtmFW5gOFFI/edit)**

*Is 13/50 even an accurate or reliable ratio to start with?* The origin of 13/50 is [from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) statistics](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/table-43) [1]. Technically, these stats give you **13/50 for homicides and not all violent crime** (the crime number is way lower, at 27.4%, and they don’t actually compile the exact violent crime % for us), and even these statistics show that [black people were arrested for ](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-3.xls)[**38.7% of homicides**](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-3.xls) [2] when you include thousands of homicides where the race of the perpetrator was unknown, so the people using 13/50 should actually be using 13/38 (or at least acknowledge we don’t have an exact number and that our best guess would be within a broader range). It’s not even surprising that we don’t know the race of many murderers -  [**around 40% of reported homicides go unsolved**](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://nypost.com/2018/09/25/a-shocking-number-of-us-murders-went-unsolved-last-year/) [3], a huge gap in the data, and [in general we see a lot of crime go unreported to police](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/vnrp0610.pdf) [4]. On top of this, when you use the 38.7% figure, [this UCR data still has limitations for the following reasons](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/ucr/a-word-about-ucr-data.pdf/view):

\1. **The statistic refers to arrests made, not convictions or any other research body on this issue**. FBI Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) stats are collected from law enforcement, not courts nor any other groups [5]. If police departments are racist and disproportionately arrest Black suspects ([which](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/tinyurl.com/systemicracismdoc) [they](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAA-w5DiAAU) [probably](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/opinions/wp/2018/09/18/theres-overwhelming-evidence-that-the-criminal-justice-system-is-racist-heres-the-proof/) [do](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VAFe_CXE-4zVnx-jxuW1Me8IJr5p3RDMcHC-yoaaNp8/edit) [6]), then the number of “Black homicides” would artificially increase.

a. Even if police aren’t racist towards black people and just happen to spend too many resources in majority-black areas compared to majority white areas, there’d still be an artificial increase in arrests from black areas by virtue of them over-policing the black area. [This basic thought experiment is clarified in this video](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://youtu.be/E8hj4IseFP4?t=131) (from 2:11 to 3:30).[7]

\2. It relies on voluntary reports from local law enforcement agencies [5], so **it can easily suffer from racially-driven selection bias** ([as further evidenced in this source](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d56b/73bb7e1b72a8436e571761078a1be8ebc227.pdf) [8]). Law enforcement agencies are essentially allowed to choose whether to disclose their data or not. This might not be a minor problem, either - back in 2017 the [FBI found that a significant number of agencies weren’t reporting those numbers](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://psmag.com/news/federal-agencies-failing-to-report-to-fbi-national-database) to the FBI. [9]

\3. The UCR program admits that **it doesn’t have a real means of ensuring that the data they receive is reliable**. “The accuracy of the statistics depends primarily on the adherence of each contributor to the established standards of reporting. It is the responsibility of each state UCR Program or individual contributing law enforcement agency to submit accurate monthly statistics or correct existing data that are in error.” [5]

Keep in mind that **this doesn’t necessarily mean blacks don’t commit a disproportionate amount of crime**. All this really does is show that 13/50 is based on data which is unreliable and that people who use 13/50 blindly probably don’t know what they’re talking about.

*What if we disregarded any inaccuracies which lower the 13/50 ratio or make it unreliable?* Even then, if the result of your data is that you are now saying “blacks are only 13% of the population but do 50% of the crime” then the correct response isn't to use this as some kind of ammo for online arguments on “black people bad.” It’d be better to say, “so what are the factors that are leading black people to commit a higher number of crimes than other races, and what can be done to reduce this number?” **Throwing around 13/50 without providing any deeper analysis doesn’t actually tell us what to do to lower that purported ratio.**

**The 13/50 data also doesn’t account for other variables - it’s raw UCR data, and thus lacks context with which we could make any meaningful interpretation of the data**. This means that it doesn’t control for factors like poverty, family instability, urbanity, and so on, which all have a significant role in crime levels. Without controlling for all of these factors plus more, it’s hard to use 13/50 to make any claims regarding innate racial differences, racial discrimination, etc. If someone tries to take 13/50 and, without any further analysis, conclude that blacks are just inferior to whites, they are simply an idiot.

What if we do try to account for some of those variables? Let’s see what happens - [from the Bureau of Justice Statistics](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=5137) [10], **after accounting for poverty and urbanity** (which are strong predictors in crime levels), ‘**Poor urban blacks** (51.3 per 1,000) **had rates of violence similar to poor urban whites** (56.4 per 1,000)’. Keep in mind though that [there are a number of predictors of crime and that it’s not a very clear cut issue at all](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-doesnt-know-why-crime-rises-or-falls-neither-does-biden-or-any-other-politician/) [11], which means that just blaming crime on just these two particular factors could be just as misguided as blaming crime on just race.

*What if we did accept 13/50 to be a completely accurate portrayal of reality which pertains to all violent crime and not just homicides?* Well, even this still isn’t necessarily damning to black people as a group. Crime rates within population groups [tend to be skewed to a small minority of that population](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3969807/) [12], and regardless high crime rates don’t justify abandoning or discriminating against black people.

● For one, **we must consider that most violent crime is done by a very small group of people** - [1% of the population in Sweden does 63% of the violent crime](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3969807/), for example [12]. In the US, most of the violent crime in the 13/50 ratio is probably also clustered within a 1% which does most crime, so this is even less damning to 13% as a whole compared to just that 1%. This gives us perspective on how much 13% is actually responsible for 50%, which is not very much.

● One variant of 13/50 is 6/50, which focuses specifically on black men. Not only is this [in line with existing UCR stats](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-3.xls) [2] (disregarding UCR’s reliability), it’s also a passive admission that **black women commit almost no violent crime, so already half of 13% isn’t responsible for 50%**. This suggests that homicide or violent crime isn’t necessarily a general black thing, but rather a black male thing, which really needs to be taken into consideration when making statements about the nature of black people.

● Even relying on UCR data without assuming any flaws, we see that [only ~6,000 cases of murder and nonnegligent manslaughter were done by black people](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/crime/ucr.asp?table_in=2&selYrs=2018&rdoGroups=1&rdoData=c) [13] (or ~5000 [if you want to go by the original UCR data](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/table-43) [1]). Even if we assume that every single homicide was committed by a different person (which is highly unlikely), that’s still barely representative of the broader black population of ~50 million in the US. Over 99% of black people will never be murderers.

● **The exact same sort of logic applied to 13/50 can be applied to men and violent crime, where the ratio trends around 50/90** (despite making up 50% of the population, men commit 90% of violent crime). Despite 13/50 and 50/90 having a similar 40 point disparity, most promoters of 13/50 oppose anti-male discrimination, and for good reason: men face oppression in certain parts of society but at the end of the day should still be treated like humans, not subhumans. Society at large does teach men to work in more dangerous jobs, to have a more violent mentality, and so on -- and even if men are biologically predisposed to violent behavior (which is probably true to some extent), this doesn’t change that men are still human and should be treated as such. The exact same should apply to black people, even if they commit a wildly disproportionate amount of crime and even if they’re biologically inclined to do so.

# **Holocaust Denial/Revisionism**
**Here are a few rebuttals to Holocaust denial talking points, though not all unsubstantiated denier claims warrant an academic paper in response. The Liberal Sanity Project, who helped with Vaush’s original document, [has a good video on this](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_YFgugVhns).**

**A quick word on Holocaust Deniers/Revisionists - oftentimes, they’re not open to new information or evidence. Unless they’re listening to others with their beliefs, they’ll have all the incentive in the world to troll and act in bad faith as they don’t expect a good faith response from non-believers (social stigma against Nazism plays a good role in this). With this in mind, these debunks will usually do nothing of value for you because they just don’t care what you bring to the table.**

A few general resources for addressing a wide variety of claims:

● **CLAIM: The estimated number of Jewish deaths in the Holocaust is wildly overinflated.**

○ [This extensive and well-sourced post](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/76avmk/how_do_we_estimate_the_number_of_jewish_deaths_in/doco9me/) explains how modern historians arrived at their estimation of Jewish Holocaust deaths (5.4 - 6.2 million).

○ There is lively academic debate within that range (Nazis kept poor records so we will never have a completely accurate answer) but no serious historian believes in any figure which deviates significantly from that range.

○ A passage from *Denying History* - *Historians are the ones who should be described as revisionists. To receive a Ph.D. and become a professional historian, one must write an original work with research based on primary documents and new sources, reexamining or reinterpreting some historical event—in other words, revising knowledge about that event only. This is not to say, however, that revision is done for revision’s sake; it is done when new evidence or new interpretations call for a revision.*

*Historians have revised and continue to revise what we know about the Holocaust. But their revision entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events, rarely complete denial of the events themselves, and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the Holocaust.*

*Holocaust deniers claim that there is a force field of dogma around the Holocaust—set up and run by the Jews themselves—shielding it from any change. Nothing could be further from the truth. Whether or not the public is aware of the academic debates that take place in any field of study, Holocaust scholars discuss and argue over any number of points as research continues. Deniers do know this.*

● **CLAIM: Zyklon B is just a delousing agent, it can’t kill people! It was used to clean clothes! Also, even if it was lethal, why do some “gas chambers” [lack the blue stain Zyklon B leaves on walls](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://i.imgur.com/X5n9l6f.jpg)?**

○ First of all, Zyklon B can absolutely be used to kill. [Just Wikipedia it](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zyklon_B%23Use_in_the_Holocaust).

○ Secondly, Zyklon B must be used in higher concentrations to kill lice than to kill humans. It’s more economical to use less gas, so the blue gas residue wouldn’t form as easily in gas chambers.

○ Third, Zyklon B residue can be easily cleaned from walls, and Nazis made every effort to destroy evidence of the Holocaust as Soviet soldiers marched in.

○ Fourth, even this stupid image acknowledges there are traces of (again, easily-cleanable) Zyklon B in the gas chamber.

● **CLAIM: The Auschwitz memorial plaque death figure suddenly [CHANGED from 4 million dead to 1.5 million dead](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://i.imgur.com/P1scrSN.jpg). What are they hiding?**

○ The 4 million figure was initially published by the Soviet State Commission in 1945, long before any reliable estimates were available.

○ As new information is made available, historians revise general knowledge of the subject. This is how the field of history works.

● **CLAIM: The “gas chamber” doors were [made from WOOD](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://i.imgur.com/iQ4blnJ.jpg). They clearly weren’t meant to contain people.**

○ The wooden doors presented in these images led to delousing rooms, not gas chambers. These are literally just pictures of wooden doors. It is not known what the original gas chamber doors looked like because Nazis destroyed those facilities before Soviet soldiers arrived.

○ [This door](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://i.imgur.com/A0T8lNZ.jpg), however, was found in the building yard of Auschwitz and is believed to be the kind used in their gas chambers.

○ The doors may have been destroyed, but the receipts for those doors were not. [This receipt ](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://i.imgur.com/1ZRz9FO.png)calls for an order *“on 6/3/1943 concerning the delivery of a gas tight door 100 x 192 cm for cellar I of Krematorium III, to be produced to the identical pattern and dimensions as the cellar door of Krematorium II which is situated opposite, with peephole of double 8 mm glass, with rubber sealing strip and frame.”*

● **CLAIM: The camp crematoriums could not have handled that many bodies! It takes 4-8 hours to cremate a body.**

○ It takes 1-5 hours to cremate a *civilian* body at a *professional service*. It takes far less time to cremate a body in an industrial furnace when speed takes priority over cleanliness and decency.

○ Also, Holocaust victims were not cremated one at a time. Toph and Sons (the makers of the Auschwitz crematoriums) claimed their units could handle 4-6 bodies an hour.

○ *The bodies were ". . . sorted according to their combustibility: for the bodies of the well-nourished were to help burn the emaciated. Under the direction of the Kapos, the bearers began sorting the dead into four stacks. The largest consisted mainly of strong men, the next in size of women, then came children, and lastly a stack of dead Mussulmans, emaciated and nothing but skin and bones. This technique was called 'express work,' a designation thought up by the Kommandoführers and originating from experiments carried out in crematorium 5 in the autumn of 1943. The purpose of these experiments was to find a way of saving coke. . . . Thus the bodies of two Mussulmans were cremated together with those of two children or the bodies of two well-nourished men together with that of an emaciated woman, each load consisting of three, or sometimes, four bodies." Filip Müller, Sonderkommando - Filip Müller*

○ When crematoriums failed, they used burning pits.

○ [https://www.hdot.org/debunking-denial/ab4-civilian-ovens-comparison/](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.hdot.org/debunking-denial/ab4-civilian-ovens-comparison/) Comparing the civilian cremation process to the process at Auschwitz-Birkenau is misguided. The authorities in Auschwitz-Birkenau abandoned any respect for the dead and did not abide by civilian rules for cremation. They burned multiple bodies at one time, continuously pushing in more to keep the fires hot.

● **CLAIM: The Red Cross visited a “death camp” and [found that it wasn’t inhumane](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://i.imgur.com/kIACOBc.jpg)!**

○ The Red Cross inspectors were not allowed to visit the parts of the camp intended for genocide and they had Nazis prepare their camp for scrutiny, deporting the near-dead and sanitizing the presented facilities.

○ *"I repeatedly witnessed guided tours of civilians and also of commissions of the Red Cross and other parties within the camp, and I was able to ascertain that the camp leadership arranged it masterfully to conduct these guided tours in such a way that the people being guided around did not see anything about inhuman treatment. The main camp was shown only and in this main camp there were so-called show blocks, particularly block 13, that were especially prepared for such guided tours and that were equipped like a normal soldier's barracks with beds that had sheets on them, and well-functioning washrooms." - SS-Untersturmführer Hans Münch*

○ Additionally, that letter tallying camp deaths is attributable to the International Tracing Service, not the Red Cross. They tally estimates, not records, and are not historically relevant.

● **CLAIM: The prisoners at Auschwitz [had a swimming pool](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://jan27.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/auschwitz-swimming-pool-ladder.jpg)! And a band! And a brothel! And a goddamn soccer team! And a dentist! Some prison, huh?**

○ All these amenities were present at Auschwitz I - the main camp, which held POWs, not Holocaust victims. The infamous extermination camp was Auschwitz-Birkenau. Also, the band and “pool” were for the guards exclusively. The “pool’s” main purpose [was actually that of a backup water reservoir](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.com/2017/05/rebutting-twitter-denial-most-popular.html%23auschwitzswimmingpool).

○ Even if these amenities were present at Auschwitz-Birkenau, it wouldn’t disprove anything concerning the Holocaust.

● **CLAIM: the Auschwitz crematoriums could not have killed 4 million people during the time it was in operation!**

○ The officially accepted death count for Auschwitz-Birkenau is closer to 1 million than 4 million, so the claim is already very misleading. Regardless, the death camp could still hypothetically have killed 4 million within its time of operation.

○ [https://www.hdot.org/debunking-denial/ab3-german-documents-ovens/](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://www.hdot.org/debunking-denial/ab3-german-documents-ovens/) The central office of Auschwitz-Birkenau asserts they could cremate, per day, 340 persons in crematorium 1, 1440 persons in crematorium 2, 1440 persons in crematorium 3, 768 persons in crematorium 4, 768 persons in crematorium 5, which totals to 4765 persons per day, 1,737,129 persons per year, and 4,690,248 persons over Auschwitz-Birkenau's 2.7 years of operation.

○ Further, the issue is ultimately irrelevant; when the ovens’ daily capacities were exceeded, bodies were burned in open-air pits.

● “Interestingly, a lesser percentage of U.S. military veterans polled (61%) believed not standing for the anthem was also disrespectful. In short, Republicans, who often associate the anthem with the military, are more likely to be offended on behalf of the military than veterans themselves.”

■ A significant 35% of military veterans DO NOT believe anthem protests are disrespectful. While 35% does not constitute a majority, it does make up a significant minority of dissent to put to rest common assumptions military members are a monolithic group with a monolithic opinion.
