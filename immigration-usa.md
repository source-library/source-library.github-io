# **Crime**
**Immigrants to the US commit less crime than native citizens.**

- [FEE: Nowrasteh 15](https://fee.org/articles/by-the-numbers-do-immigrants-cause-crime/)
  - Census Data
    - In **2010**, **10.7** percent of native-born men aged 18-39 without a high school degree were incarcerated **compared to 2.8 percent** of Mexican immigrants **and 1.7 percent** of Guatemalan and Salvadoran immigrants.
    - *“The disparity in incarceration rates has **existed for decades**… incarceration rates of the native-born were anywhere from **two to five times higher** than that of immigrants.”*
  - Macro-Analysis
    - **159 cities** at three dates between 1980 and 2000: crime rates and levels of immigration are **not correlated (**Ousey and Kubrin)
    - **111 US cities** with populations of at least 5,000 Hispanics and found no statistically significant findings. (Martinez 2008)
    - **150 Metropolitan Statistical Areas** (MSAs) and found that levels of recent immigration had a statistically significant downward effect on homicide rates but no effect on property crime rates. (Reid et al. 2005)

- [American Immigration Council: Ewing et al. 15](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/criminalization-immigration-united-states)
  - The violent crime rate **declined by 48%** and the property crime rate by **41%** during the period of 1990 to 2013, while the undocumented population **more than tripled** from 3.5 million to 11.2 million.
  - Keep in mind that correlation =/= causation, which makes this source pretty weak

- [Consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Immigration_and_crime&oldid=967879972%23Crime) (it’s wikipedia)
  - 26 citations
  - There is no empirical evidence that either legal or illegal immigration increases crime rate in the United States
  - Most studies in the U.S. have found lower crime rates among immigrants than among non-immigrants, and that higher concentrations of immigrants are associated with lower crime rates

- [PEW 13](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/10/15/crime-rises-among-second-generation-immigrants-as-they-assimilate/)
  - The crime rate among second-generation immigrants increases to “catch up” to the native population

- [Falk et al. 13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3969807/)
  - The majority of violent crimes are perpetrated by a small number of persistent violent offenders, typically males, characterized by early onset of violent criminality, substance abuse, personality disorders, and nonviolent criminality.
  - To take away in this context: America’s current legal immigration system does a rather good job filtering these people out because highly specialized, rich, etc people tend to not have these issues

- [Light & Miller 18](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1745-9125.12175)
  - Longitudinal analysis of the **relationship between ILLEGAL immigration and violent crime**, using data from a variety of sources that covers all 50 US states from 1990-2014
    - Violent crime here is considered to be homicide, aggravated assault, robbery, and rape
  - Finds that the **relationship between illegal immigration and violent crime is generally negative**
  - Suggests that **common explanations for this relationship don’t have much evidence**: “*Using supplemental models of victimization data and instrumental variable methods, we find little evidence that these results are due to decreased reporting or selective migration to avoid crime.*”

- [**Gunadi 2020**](https://economics.ucr.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/JMP-Christian-Gunadi.pdf)
  - Specifically deals with DACA and local crime rates
  - **“Thee results of this analysis show no evidence that DACA statistically significantly affected the incarceration rate of undocumented youth. Furthermore, [..] implementation of DACA is not associated with a statistically significant change in violent crime rate.”**
  - **“ However, there is evidence that the enactment of DACA is associated with lower property crime rates. An increase of one DACA application approved per 1,000 population (∼1 S.D. increase) is associated with 1.6% decline in overall property crime rate. Further analysis shows that this reduction is driven by the decline in burglary and larceny rates.”**

  - Study suggests **immigration often leads to decrease in social trust**, but results were **heavily affected by ethnic polarization & economic stability**.
  - With low polarization and a good economy, immigration was shown to actually **increase social trust**.
  - Results suggest **it isn’t the diversity of immigrants** which lessens trust, but rather the **economic and political context in which they arrive.**

  - “[Our] data show[s] consistently across seven studies that individuals’ outgroup attitudes are more positive when living in social contexts in which people have, on average, more positive intergroup contact. Moreover, we found a consistent contextual effect of contact on prejudice in each study: indeed, the effect of intergroup contact between social contexts is greater than the effect of individual-level contact within contexts. In four studies we provided evidence that this contextual effect is accompanied by more tolerant social norms that possibly explain the larger effect of intergroup contact on the social-context level of analysis. **Thus, positive intergroup contact is associated with reduced prejudice on a macro- and not merely [micro level], whereby people are influenced by the behavior of others in their wider social context**” (Christ et al… [pg. 4]).

  - Migrants fill important niches both in fast-growing and declining sectors of the economy
  - Migrants contribute significantly to labor-market flexibility
  - Migrants contribute more in taxes and social contributions than they receive in benefits

  - immigrants are twice as likely to become entrepreneurs and that number is going up. A quarter of engineering and technology companies started in the United States between 2006–2012  had at least one key founder who was an immigrant. Immigrant startups hire over 500,000 in America and they generated $63 billion in sales in 2012. Immigrant founders from top venture-backed firms have created an average of approximately 150 jobs per company in the United States

<summary>Jobs and Wages</summary>

# **Jobs and Wages**
**Immigrants are a necessary component of the job market and entrepreneurship. Low-skill immigrants only sometimes cause minor depressions in the wages of low-skill native workers (those without high school diploma) and other low-skill immigrants, yet even in these cases, wage depressions are very small.**

- [Brookings: Hoban 17](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brookings-now/2017/08/24/do-immigrants-steal-jobs-from-american-workers/)
  - Immigrants are highly skilled and necessary to the job market
  - College graduates are more prevalent among recent immigrant adults than among all adults in **90 of the 100** largest metropolitan areas.

- [National Bureau of Economic Research: Kerr 16](https://www.nber.org/papers/w22385.pdf) [(cited)](https://hbr.org/2016/10/immigrants-play-a-disproportionate-role-in-american-entrepreneurship)
  - Immigrants contribute to entrepreneurship and innovation greatly
  - Immigrants constitute **15%** of the general U.S. workforce, but they account for around a quarter of U.S. entrepreneurs
  - This immigrant share of entrepreneurship has been **increasing dramatically** since the mid-1990s
  - *“Most of our work focuses on 11 states present in the LEHD since 1992, which include California and Florida. We estimate 24% of entrepreneurs in these states from 1995-2008 are immigrants, which broadly corresponds with other studies. As important, this immigrant entrepreneurship share [rose] from 17% in 1995 to 27% in 2008” (*Kerr & Kerr 16 [pg. 2]).

  - **National Bureau of Economic Research** paper on the effects immigration has on wages in the United States

  - Research shows average American wage **RISES due to immigration**, both short-term and long-term
  - **Only native demographic whose wages drop are High School dropouts** who suffer a decrease in wages of approximately **~2% short-term, alleviating to ~1.1% over time.**
  - Study finds **new immigration does severely impact wages of prior immigrants**, suggesting **lack of substitutability with \*natives**.
  - Overall, **vast majority of American workers’ wages increase from immigration**, High School dropouts (<10% of population) experience a slight **decrease which alleviates with time** (and there is evidence that immigration [**may increase native High School graduation rates**](https://www.nber.org/papers/w18047.pdf), too).

  - Famous research on the **Mariel Boatlift** and the impact of a **wave of Cuban immigrants (mostly low-skilled)** on the economy of **Miami**.
  - Research found essentially **no impact on native wages**, even for **low-skilled workers**, despite the Mariel Boatlift **increasing Miami’s labor force by seven percent.**
  - Even **former Cuban immigrants** didn’t seem to be affected.
  - Note: this stuff was revisited by George Borjas who found different results, but [his work on the subject has received a good bit of criticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariel_boatlift%232016_reappraisal) (see *Studies to Watch Out For* section of this doc for more info)

  - When measured over a period of 10 years or more, **the impact of immigration on the wages of native-born workers overall is very small**. To the extent that negative impacts occur, they are most likely to be found for prior immigrants or native-born workers who have not completed high school—who are often the closest substitutes for immigrant workers with low skills.
  - **There is little evidence that immigration significantly affects the overall employment levels of native-born workers**. As with wage impacts, there is some evidence that recent immigrants reduce the employment rate of prior immigrants. In addition, recent research finds that immigration reduces the number of hours worked by native teens (but not their employment levels).
  - Immigration has an overall positive impact on long-run economic growth in the U.S.
  - Some evidence on inflow of skilled immigrants suggests that **there may be positive wage effects for some subgroups of native-born workers, and other benefits to the economy more broadly**.

- [Ojeda 09](http://wcvi.org/intermestic_initiatives/FinalWCVIWhitePaperLegalization.pdf) 
  - Report which investigates the effects of the “The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986” (IRCA) which led the way to the legalization of over 2.7 million undocumented immigrants within five years.
  - Finds that when the Department of Labor reported over the four year period following legalization (1988-1992) of undocumented immigrants, that **the mean hourly wages of the general U.S. worker grew by 15%. (16.1% for the mean hourly wage of a U.S. citizen worker)**
  - Keep in mind, that legalization occurred at the same time in a period when the U.S. unemployment rate rose from 5.3% to 7.5%
  - “Almost immediately, **IRCA-based legalization had the effect of giving rights to more workers, raising the low wage floor of the economy, reducing the demand for easily exploitable immigrants, and reducing illegal crossings and apprehensions**. (-- without huge expenditures on a border wall).”

  - Undocumented Immigrants paid an estimated **$10.6 billion** to state and local taxes in 2010
  - Allowing undocumented immigrants to work in the United States legally would increase their state and local tax contributions by an estimated **$2 billion** a year

- [Social Security Administration (SSA) 13](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/NOTES/pdf_notes/note151.pdf) 
  - Undocumented Immigrants paying an estimated **$12 billion a year into Social Security** with no intention of ever collecting benefits
    - *“we estimate that earnings by unauthorized immigrants result in a net positive effect on Social Security financial status generally, and that this effect contributed roughly $12 billion to the cash flow of the program for 2010. We estimate that future years will experience a **continuation of this positive impact** on the trust funds.”*

- [New American Economy Factsheet](https://www.newamericaneconomy.org/issues/undocumented-immigrants/%23economic-contributors,-not-criminals): Key Takeaways

  - In terms of fiscal impacts, first-generation immigrants are more costly to governments, mainly at the state and local levels, than are the native-born, in large part due to the costs of educating their children. However, as adults, **the children of immigrants (the second generation) are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the U.S. population, contributing more in taxes than either their parents or the rest of the native-born population**.
  - Over the long term, the impacts of immigrants on government budgets are generally positive at the federal level but remain negative at the state and local level — but these generalizations are subject to a number of important assumptions. Immigration’s fiscal effects vary tremendously across states.

**From a purely economic perspective, mass deportation of illegal immigrants would severely undermine stability and economic well-being**

- [New American Economy Factsheet](https://www.newamericaneconomy.org/issues/undocumented-immigrants/%23economic-contributors,-not-criminals)
  - Mass deportation of illegal immigrants would result in a:
    - **6.4%** shrink in the labor force
    - **5.7%** shrink in the economy
    - **$1.6** trillion reduction in GDP
    - **$409** billion direct cost to the federal government

  - the budgetary and economic implications of alternative strategies to addressing undocumented immigrants.
  - $400 billion to $600 billion to address the 11.2 million undocumented immigrants and prevent future unlawful entry into the United States.
  - In turn, this would shrink the labor force by 11 million workers and reduce real GDP by $1.6 trillion.
  - Depending on how the government conducts its apprehensions, it would need to spend $100 billion to $300 billion arresting and removing all undocumented immigrants residing in the country, a process that we estimate would take 20 years.
  - As a result [of the labour shrinkage], **20 years from now the economy would be nearly 6 percent or $1.6 trillion smaller than it would be if the government did not remove all undocumented immigrants.**

Since gang members seldom have travel documents, authorities cannot prove an individual is not from the country he declares as his point of origin. **Some of the deportations are reported to be deliberately planned as a way for a selected MS-­‐13 member to obtain a ‘free ride’ to a specific country**.” Through targeting deportations, the gang is able to deepen their influence through gathering more recruits and resources across countries, only later to come back to the US even bigger than before, and a vicious cycle is born.
