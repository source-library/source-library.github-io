# **U.S. Healthcare Problems**
**U.S. lags behind developed countries on a number of metrics in regards to healthcare, especially in terms of cost-efficiency and effectiveness**

- [OECD data](https://data.oecd.org/healthres/health-spending.htm)
  - **U.S. spends a lot more government money on healthcare per capita than developed countries** that have more successful healthcare systems
  - *Note: a [version](https://archive.ph/o/uY9Yr/https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/640905968686727169/unknown.png) of the data said that **voluntary** healthcare spending in the U.S. was disproportionately high, but that version is outdated. Even then, voluntary healthcare spending in the US is on the high end compared to other OECD countries.*

  - U.S. has spent more than other developed countries when it comes to healthcare, and **that gap has widened over time**

- [Gagnon 08](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050001)
  - Finds that in the USA, “**pharmaceutical companies spend almost twice as much on promotion as they do on R&D**. These numbers clearly show how promotion predominates over R&D in the pharmaceutical industry, contrary to the industry's claim.”
  - [2002 study with similar results](https://web.archive.org/web/20100219022132/https://www.familiesusa.org/assets/pdfs/PPreport89a5.pdf)
  - Rather outdated by this point, unfortunately
  - This is opposed to a [2018 study on Canadian pharmaceutical companies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5848527/) which **found mixed/opposite results**

- [Moses et al. 13](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/1769890)
  - In real terms, **healthcare costs have tripled** from 1980-2011, and **most price increases** (91%) were due to **professional services, drugs and devices, and administrative costs** - not demand for services or aging of the population
  - Government funding of healthcare has increased by 11% from 1980 to 2011, yet US healthcare still lags behind other comparable countries on multiple metrics, such as life expectancy at birth and survival with many diseases

<summary>U.S. Medicare for All</summary>

# **U.S. Medicare for All**
**Universal health care could save money if properly implemented**

- [Cai et al. 20](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003013)
  - META ANALYSIS: 91% of peer reviewed journals say that **Medicare-For-All would save money in both the short-run and the long-run**
  - Found and compared cost analyses of 22 single-payer plans for the US or individual states
  - “*The largest source of savings was simplified payment administration (median 8.8%), and the best predictors of net savings were the magnitude of utilization increase, and savings on administration and drug costs*”

- [Pollin et al. 18](https://www.peri.umass.edu/publication/item/1127-economic-analysis-of-medicare-for-all)
  - An assessment of a possible M4A plan in the U.S.
  - As of right now, 35% of Americans are uninsured or underinsured on their current healthcare plans
  - “***Medicare for All could reduce total health care spending in the U.S. by nearly 10 percent, to $2.93 trillion, while creating stable access to good care for all U.S. residents.***”
  - This assessment had **[largely positive reviews from multiple experts in the field**](https://www.peri.umass.edu/reviewer-assessments-of-economic-analysis-of-medicare-for-all)**

  - A recent Lancet [article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673619330193) suggests that M4A would lead to a 13% savings in national health expenditure (equivalent to about $450 billion annually)
    - The same study estimates that on a yearly basis, 68,000 lives and 1.73 MILLION life-years will be saved, relative to our system.

- Sixty-one percent of enrollees who had used their insurance to get care said they would not have been able to afford or access it prior to enrolling. Doctor availability and appointment wait times are similar to those reported by insured Americans overall. Majorities with marketplace or Medicaid coverage continue to be satisfied with their insurance. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27224966/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27224966/)

# **General Universal Healthcare Benefits**

- [Kirros et al. 20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7060592/) 
  - Study into health system and infant mortality in Sub Saharan Africa
  - *'Both public and external health care spending showed a significant negative association with infant and neonatal mortality. However, private health expenditure was not significantly associated with either infant or neonatal mortality.'*

- Public sector healthcare is no more cost-efficient, accountable, or medical effectiveness. Public healthcare has an issue of timeliness and hospitality, while private healthcare frequently violated medical standards of practice and had poorer patient outcomes [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3378609/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3378609/) 

- Single payer has superior equity with no difference in quality. Universal healthcare coverage is ‘the most powerful concept that public health has to offer’.

- Public sector research produces the most innovative drugs. Public sector research funds base research for all drugs and is indirectly involved in the production of half of all drug research [https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2009.0917](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2009.0917)

- Industry Life Cycle - Final stage of industry maturity is consolidation
  - There is persistent vertical and horizontal consolidation of hospitals and providers in the US healthcare industry, significantly reducing the benefits derived from markets. [https://www.kff.org/health-costs/issue-brief/what-we-know-about-provider-consolidation/](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/issue-brief/what-we-know-about-provider-consolidation/) 
  - If the tendency towards consolidation/monopolization is likely to occur regardless, it should be utilized for the most social good (akin to regional monopolies like utility companies, particularly telecommunication companies) Vertical integration potentially poggers (assuming we can use it for social good) [https://journals.lww.com/hcmrjournal/Abstract/2019/04000/A_systematic_review_of_vertical_integration_and.8.aspx](https://journals.lww.com/hcmrjournal/Abstract/2019/04000/A_systematic_review_of_vertical_integration_and.8.aspx) 
  - Ie healthcare is an inelastic good, the only elasticity when it comes to price shopping are providers. How can we utilize intra-market elasticity when there is no market?
