  - The number of white supremacist murders in the United States **more than doubled** in 2017 compared to the previous year

  - A fact check of the ADL statistics (hint: they’re accurate)
    - The Daily Caller News Foundation (a right-wing news organization founded by Tucker Carlson) conducted an independent analysis of domestic extremism for the same 10-year time frame as the ADL.
    - *“Our findings **support the ADL statistic**. Using their definition of right-wing extremists, we found that **92 percent of ideologically motivated homicide** incidents were committed with a right-wing extremist or white supremacist motive.”*
  - Data is based on START homicide statistics

# **Hate Crime**
**The prevalence of hate crime is growing at increasing rates, especially those crimes with a racial bias, and especially coincide with violent or reactionary rhetoric.**

- [PolitiFact: Xu 19](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2019/apr/03/hate-crimes-are-increasingly-reported-us/)
  - The aftermath of the 2016 election (2016-17) saw an increase in **religious and ethnicity-based hate crime**

- [Edwards & Rushin 18](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3102652)
  - **Counties that voted the most in favor of Trump had the largest increases in hate crimes afterwards**
