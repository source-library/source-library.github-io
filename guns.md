# **Violence & Video Games**
**Violent video games do not cause mass shootings: there is no relationship between aggressive behavior and time spent on violent video games.**

  - Researchers have found **no relationship** between aggressive behavior in teenagers (n=1004) and the amount of time spent playing violent video games.
  - â€œThe study is one of the **most definitive to date**, using a combination of subjective and objective data to measure teen aggression and violence in games. Unlike previous research on the topic, which relied heavily on **self-reported data** from teenagers, the study used information from parents and carers to judge the level of aggressive behavior in their children.

  - Causal evidence on the **effect of exposure** to media violence on **violent crime**, using data from violent films
  - Exposure to violent movies has three main effects on violent crime:
    - It significantly **reduces violent crime** in the evening on the day of exposure
    - by an even larger percent, it reduces violent crime during the night hours following exposure
    - It has no significant impact in the days and weeks following the exposure.
