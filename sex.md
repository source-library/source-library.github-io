# **Sex Work**
**Sex work decriminalization (at least on the seller’s side) decreases violence and displacement while supporting risk reduction and peer support networks among sex workers**

- [PLOS Medicine - Platt et al. 18](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002680) [(cited here)](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-women-prostitution/legalizing-prostitution-lowers-violence-and-disease-report-says-idUSKBN1OA28N)

  - HUGE **META-ANALYSIS** of **130 studies** on **33 countries** on the legalization and policing of sex work and workers.
    - Studies were published in scientific journals between 1990 to 2018.
  - It showed that in contexts of criminalisation, the threat and enactment of police harassment, repressive policing, and arrest of sex workers or their clients:
    - **increased risk of sexual/physical violence** from clients or other parties
    - **displaced sex workers** into isolated work locations
    - **Disrupted peer support networks** and service access
    - **limited risk reduction** opportunities.
    - **discouraged** sex workers from obtaining and carrying methods of safe sex
    - **exacerbated existing inequalities** experienced by transgender, migrant, and drug-using sex workers.
  - In cites: *“Those of us who work on the street are running from the police, pushed into more isolated areas because clients are **fearful of arrest**” ~ Niki Adams of English Collective of Prostitutes*

# **Casual Sex**
**Casual sex is generally associated with normal levels of well-being. However, in certain instances, it may be harmful. Certain attitudes towards sexuality tend to moderate the negative psychological effects that may occur in younger individuals.**

- [Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health: ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20444178)[Eisenber](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Eisenberg%20ME%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_uid=20444178)g et al. [09](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20444178) 
  - Study consisting of **1,311** sexually active young adults
  - 20% of reported recent sexual encounters were casual in nature
  - Casual partnerships were more common among men than among women (29% vs. 14%)
  - The study found **no significant differences** in the **psychological wellbeing** of those who engaged in casual sex versus those who engaged in sex with a more serious partner, **regardless of gender**
  - *“Young adults who engage in casual sexual encounters do not appear to be at greater risk for harmful psychological outcomes than sexually active young adults in more committed relationships.”*

  - NEGATIVE EFFECTS on COLLEGE STUDENTS
  - This study focuses on a younger demographic: only **college students 18 to 25**
  - A greater proportion of men (18.6%) than women (7.4%) reported having casual sex in the past month
  - For emerging-adult college students, engaging in casual sex may elevate risk for **negative psychological outcomes**

- [ Social Psychological and Personality Science: Vrangalova and Ong 14](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550614537308)
  - MODERATING NEGATIVE EFFECTS - a response to the perceived harms endured by younger demographics
  - Defferenciates between **attitudes** towards casual sex
  - The study found that **sociosexuality**, “a stable personality orientation toward casual sex,” **moderated the effect** of casual sex on well-being
  - The study found that after having casual sex, **sociosexually unrestricted** students (those who were generally interested in and eager to have casual sex) typically reported **improvements in psychological wellbeing** afterward, while the psychological wellbeing of sociosexually restricted students was **generally unaffected**.

- [Archives of Sexual Behavior: Vrangalova 15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24496788)
  - A study examining the **differences in motivations** for casual sex
  - Differentiates between **autonomous and non-autonomous** motivations
    - Autonomous reasons:
- the subject was highly attracted to the other person
- The subject wanted to experiment and explore their sexuality
- The subject felt this would be a valuable learning experience
    - Non-autonomous reasons:
- the subject was drunk
- the subject was hoping it would be more than just a casual encounter
- the subject was seeking revenge on an ex
  - People having casual sex for **autonomous reasons** were for the most part **unaffected** by this activity
  - In contrast, those who engaged in casual sex for **non-autonomous reasons** typically experienced a **decrease** in psychological wellbeing

- [Michigan State University: Lie et al. 16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5052677/)
  - High frequency of sex is **positively related to later risk of cardiovascular events** for men but not women, whereas good sexual quality seems to **protect women but not men from cardiovascular risk** in later life
